to do:

Cross-scan coupling is a hard wall. Two coupled recurrences over the same axis (G and H both recur over l) are handled. But per-step intermediates depending on more than one scan axis throw a shapeMismatch error rather than attempting to schedule them (`DSL/Pipeline/Structural.lean`, the `dep.getD s.lhsName [] |>.length > 1` guard). Coupled differential equations or multi-scale recurrences hit this. This is the hardest gap — it requires expressing coupled recurrences as a single morphism, which pushes into the weave structure.

# Lean 4 Encoding of the `D`-Graded Colored PROP Framework

This document describes a Lean 4 formalisation of the NCD categorical framework as a **single structure** — the `D`-graded colored PROP of [graded_prop.md](graded_prop.md) — rather than as two independent categories. `St` and `Br` are one instantiation (`D = St`, `C = Br`); the model level (`D = Br`) and the swapped-`D` rows are others. The encoding is a layered tower of typeclasses parameterised by other typeclasses, so the propositions of [graded_prop.md §8](graded_prop.md#8-propositions-the-synthesis-organizes) are stated once, generically, and inherited at every instantiation.

The intent is **formalizability, not formalization**: definitions are given as Lean `class`/`structure` data plus named `Prop`-field laws, in the shape a Lean development transcribes directly. No proofs are written — signatures and proof obligations only.

## 1. Orientation: one structure, one seam

The framework is a single parametric development organized around **one structure** — a `D`-graded colored PROP, parameterised by an index PROP `D` and an operation PROP `C`. What might appear to be bookkeeping (UIDs, `Context`, names) is ordinary categorical data: symbolic sizes are the **fiber of the Grothendieck construction** `∫Dat`, and axis identity/alignment is the **pushout/coequalizer** of composition. Both live inside this single development. "Prove the propositions once, inherit them everywhere" becomes, in Lean, parametricity over a typeclass.

The encoding is therefore a layered tower of typeclasses, each parameterised by the classes below it. The following diagram makes that structure explicit. Read top-to-bottom as dependency order; `[X]` is a Lean typeclass constraint; `├`/`└` are sibling mixins on the same parent class; `⇣ … →` is a lateral bridge to Mathlib (the [§3](#3-the-seam-adapter-into-mathlib) seam adapter, not a new layer); `(mixin, full)` means fully specified here, `(mixin, STUB)` declared with body deferred. The three layers and their mixin branches:

```text
ColoredPROP O                                    -- lightweight base; St, Br instances
   ⇣ adapter (the seam)  →  Mathlib MonoidalCategory / SymmetricCategory
DGradedColoredPROP D C   [ColoredPROP D] [ColoredPROP C]   -- core: sh, act, δ, υ, α, axioms
   ├ TemporalGraded   D C   (mixin, full)   -- Scan, Def 3.3–3.5
   ├ RouteStructure   D C   (mixin, STUB)     -- Route, Prop 8.6(ii)      [future_ideas]
   └ SymmetryGraded   D C T (mixin, STUB)     -- equivariance monad, Prop 8.4 [gated; equiv_unif A3]
Algebra D C V   [DGradedColoredPROP D C] [TargetActegory D V]   -- construct()
   └ ParaAlgebra ...        (mixin, STUB)      -- weight tying, pass-as-2-cell  [prop_ideas: Para Refinement]
```

The base `ColoredPROP` carries the lightweight definitions and the `St`/`Br` instances; the core `DGradedColoredPROP D C` adds the grading data and laws; capabilities (`Scan`, `Route`, symmetry, `Para`) are composable mixins, and `Algebra` is the `construct()` functor into a target actegory. An instantiation pays only for the layers it declares, and the proven core is never edited — new domains are new instances, new capabilities are new mixins.

The organizing seam is the **proposition/computation** seam: **does Lean *prove* this or *compute* this?** This is the seam [graded_prop.md](graded_prop.md) itself draws. [§6](graded_prop.md#6-composition-as-pushout) is "a correctness/specification lens, not a composition algorithm": the pushout *explains and certifies* what `Context` does, it does not replace it — so the coequalizer is the *specification* and union-find plus a fresh-name counter is the *implementation*. [§7](graded_prop.md#7-algebras-construct-and-the-para-refinement) keeps the lightweight `Para` encoding and tells us to **note the gap explicitly rather than pay for a bicategory only the specification uses**. Read as the organizing principle of this document: the propositional core (PROP/actegory laws, `∫Dat`, pushout-as-colimit, equivariance, weave uniqueness) is stated over UID-free types and proved; the executable realization (fresh-UID counter, union-find, acset tables / CSV) sits on the other side of the seam, realizing the specification without being proved against it line by line. The seam adapter of [§3](#3-the-seam-adapter-into-mathlib) is exactly this boundary turned into a definition.

## 2. The base: `ColoredPROP`

Categories are encoded, following [Holtzen (2025)](https://sholtzen.dev/articles/leancat-1.html), as a Lean 4 typeclass parameterised by an object type `ob : Type`. This is the categorical skeleton on which everything else rests.

```lean
class SmallCategory (ob : Type) : Type 1 where
  hom     : ob → ob → Type
  id      : ∀ x, hom x x
  comp    : ∀ {X Y Z}, hom X Y → hom Y Z → hom X Z
  id_comp : ∀ {X Y} (f : hom X Y), comp (id X) f = f
  comp_id : ∀ {X Y} (f : hom X Y), comp f (id Y) = f
  assoc   : ∀ {W X Y Z} (f : hom W X) (g : hom X Y) (h : hom Y Z),
              comp (comp f g) h = comp f (comp g h)

-- Scoped to avoid conflict with CategoryTheory's ⟶ and Function.comp.
-- Open `ColoredPROPNotations` in files that use these; files importing Mathlib
-- use CategoryTheory's ⟶ directly via the §3 seam adapter.
-- NOTE: the `scoped[NS] notation …` attribute one-liner is a Mathlib extension; it does not
-- parse in a file with no Mathlib import. The base category file is deliberately Mathlib-free,
-- so it uses the equivalent core-Lean form (a `namespace`-delimited `scoped`):
namespace ColoredPROPNotations
scoped infixl:65 " ⟶ " => SmallCategory.hom
scoped notation:65 a " ∘ " b => SmallCategory.comp b a
end ColoredPROPNotations
```

Objects are themselves Lean types, so the monoidal product on objects can be definitional list concatenation; morphisms carry enough structure that the category laws fall to ring axioms (`St`) or list induction (`Br`) with no quotient; and the laws `id_comp`/`comp_id`/`assoc` are propositional equalities discharged by tactics.

Both **St** and **Br** are *colored PROPs* ([graded_prop.md §2](graded_prop.md), Definition 2.1): symmetric strict monoidal categories whose object monoid is the free monoid `O*` over a set of colors, with `⊗` = list concatenation and `I` = the empty list. The base class carries exactly this structure, including the elemental separation axiom `elemental` (the `(Elem)` axiom of [graded_prop.md §2](graded_prop.md)).

```lean
class ColoredPROP (ob : Type) extends SmallCategory ob where
  gen       : Type          -- O, the color set; ob = List gen = O* (the free monoid on O)
  toList    : ob → List gen
  ofList    : List gen → ob
  tensor    : ob → ob → ob := fun a b => ofList (toList a ++ toList b)
  unit      : ob := ofList []
  tensor_assoc  : ∀ a b c, tensor (tensor a b) c = tensor a (tensor b c)
  tensor_unit_l : ∀ a, tensor unit a = a
  tensor_unit_r : ∀ a, tensor a unit = a
  swap      : ∀ a b, hom (tensor a b) (tensor b a)
  tensorHom : ∀ {a b c d}, hom a b → hom c d → hom (tensor a c) (tensor b d)
  -- morphism-level symmetric-monoidal laws (tensorHom is a bifunctor; swap is an involution):
  tensorHom_id   : ∀ a c, tensorHom (id a) (id c) = id (tensor a c)
  tensorHom_comp : ∀ {a b c d e g} (f₁ : hom a b) (f₂ : hom b c) (g₁ : hom d e) (g₂ : hom e g),
                     tensorHom (comp f₁ f₂) (comp g₁ g₂) = comp (tensorHom f₁ g₁) (tensorHom f₂ g₂)
  swap_swap      : ∀ a b, comp (swap a b) (swap b a) = id (tensor a b)
```

Elementality — the **(Elem)** axiom — is **not** a `ColoredPROP` field. It is an opt-in mixin:

```text
class Elemental (ob) [ColoredPROP ob] where     -- (Elem), demoted from a base field (2026-06-22)
  elemental : ∀ {X Y} (f g : hom X Y), (∀ x : hom unit X, comp x f = comp x g) → f = g
```

For both **St** and **Br**, `ob = List gen`, so `toList = id` and `ofList = id`, and the three strictness laws `tensor_assoc`/`tensor_unit_l`/`tensor_unit_r` reduce to `List.append_assoc`, `List.nil_append`, and `List.append_nil` respectively — all dischargeable by `simp [List.append_assoc/nil_append/append_nil]`. The `swap` morphism is a rearrangement that interleaves or separates the two sub-lists, and `tensorHom` is the parallel product. The morphism-level laws `tensorHom_id`/`tensorHom_comp` (bifunctoriality of the parallel product) and `swap_swap` (the symmetry is an involution) complete the symmetric-monoidal structure; they are what let the §3 seam exhibit the bifunctorial part of a Mathlib `MonoidalCategory` sorry-free (see [§13](#13-lean-formalization-notes)).

**Elementality (`El(X) := hom unit X`, points separate parallel morphisms) is an opt-in `Elemental` mixin, not a base `ColoredPROP` field.** The (Elem) axiom states `(∀ x : hom unit X, x ; f = x ; g) → f = g` — equivalently the family `{(x ; −)}_{x ∈ El(X)}` is jointly injective — and it is what forces a morphism's cartesian-lift datum to be **unique** (weave uniqueness, [§5](#5-weaves-as-cartesian-lift-data), Prop 8.2). It was originally a mandatory field; it was **demoted to a mixin (2026-06-22)** for three reasons:

- **It is not load-bearing for the executable target.** Runtime tensor-*slice* extraction — the Pythonic `x[i,:,j]` — is a `Br` reindexing built from **`St`** elements (shape coordinates), so it rests on **`St` elementality**, which is proved sorry-free (`St.elemental`). **`Br`** elementality is the *separate* claim that value-families separate `Br` operations; nothing the target *does* uses it (see [graded_prop.md §3.2](graded_prop.md#32-axioms) "Which elementality slices use — St, not Br").
- **Its sole consumer is an unproved leaf.** `Br` elementality (`brCancelPoint`) feeds only `weave_unique` (Prop 8.2) — itself a `sorry`, double-gated on `broadcast_gen` (also a `sorry`), and consumed by nothing. As a *mandatory* field it forced the `Br : ColoredPROP` instance to carry a deep free-strict-SMC normal-form proof that no proved or executable result depends on.
- **Demotion unblocks `Br : ColoredPROP` today without discarding the theorem.** As a mixin, `Br : ColoredPROP` is sorry-free; `instance : Elemental BrObj` carries the deferred `brCancelPoint`, and `weave_unique` takes `[Elemental C]` so it stays statable and provable when actually pursued (alongside `broadcast_gen`). `St`'s elementality remains an `Elemental StObj` instance, sorry-free.

**The `brCancelPoint` proof is preserved and resumable.** All in-tree machinery is kept — `brPoint`, the `brCancelPoint` `sorry` with its full diagnostic doc-comment, and the `elemental ⟸ brCancelPoint` reduction (now the body of `Elemental BrObj`). The work-in-progress proof (an NbE / free-SMC normal-form model — representation + `eval` pipeline built, first laws diagnosed) lives in gitignored scratch and is logged in the project memory; see the `brCancelPoint` comment in `LeanNCD/Base/Br.lean` for the route and the resume pointer.

The `ColoredPROP` typeclass earns its keep in three ways: generic rearrangements (any list permutation induces a morphism in any colored PROP, proved once), the `St → Br` relationship (the `reindexings` of a `BrBase` are a family of **St** morphisms inside a **Br** morphism — the data of a monoidal functor `St → Br`), and the interchange law `(f ; g) ⊗ (h ; k) = (f ⊗ h) ; (g ⊗ k)`, derivable once from `tensorHom` and `assoc`.

### 2.1 `Numeric`

Both **St** and **Br** rely on symbolic dimension expressions — terms in a free commutative ring on `String`-named generators. Two roles need DIFFERENT coefficient rings: axis **sizes** are non-negative, so they live in `Numeric = MvPolynomial String ℕ` (a `CommSemiring`); affine **stride coefficients and offsets** are *signed* (a look-back read `X[i-1]` has offset `-1`), so they live in `Coeff = MvPolynomial String ℤ` (a `CommRing`). Both are Mathlib types with `DecidableEq` and a `ring`-ready algebra for free, covering the Python `Numeric` hierarchy (`Integer`, `FreeNumeric`, `Addition`, `Multiplication`, `Power`) uniformly.

```lean
abbrev Numeric := MvPolynomial String ℕ   -- axis SIZES (non-negative); a CommSemiring
abbrev Coeff   := MvPolynomial String ℤ   -- StMat COEFFICIENTS/offsets (signed); a CommRing
-- free variable s  ↦  MvPolynomial.X s     (a degree-1 monomial)
-- literal n        ↦  MvPolynomial.C ↑n    (a constant polynomial)
-- addition, multiplication ↦ ring operations
-- instances : CommSemiring Numeric / CommRing Coeff, DecidableEq — free from Mathlib (NONCOMPUTABLE)
```

These are the minimal types making `StMat`'s laws provable: free commutative algebras on a `String`-indexed generator set. The `ring` tactic works immediately over any `CommSemiring`/`CommRing`, so all three `StMat` laws discharge without setup over `Coeff`. `MvPolynomial.X s` plays the role of a `FreeNumeric` — a name carrying no interpretation until indeterminates are substituted. **(Why two types:** an earlier design used `Numeric` for both roles, but its ℕ-semiring has no additive inverses, so negative look-back offsets — supported by the DSL and the [§14.3](#143-abstract-syntax) `IdxExpr` — were unrepresentable; separating out the signed `Coeff` fixes that while keeping sizes non-negative.)

Mathlib's `CommSemiring (MvPolynomial …)` instance is **noncomputable** (it factors through `AddMonoidAlgebra`); so are `MvPolynomial.X`/`.C` and even `DecidableEq` (which resolves through `Classical.propDecidable`). This has no effect on the proof tower — `ring`/`simp` and the [§11](#11-the-propositions-as-generic-theorems) proofs work fine over a noncomputable semiring — but it has two consequences (`Coeff = MvPolynomial String ℤ` is noncomputable for the same reason). (i) Any `def` that *builds* a value over `Numeric`/`Coeff` (so `StMat.id`, `StMat.comp`, and the `St` instance of [§2.2](#22-st--stride-matrices)) must be marked `noncomputable`. (ii) **Compiled code cannot construct or `decide`-compare `Numeric`/`Coeff` values at all** — neither `#eval`, `decide`, nor `native_decide` reduces them. The executable / DSL layer must therefore not construct `Numeric` directly: the tensor-logic DSL ([§14](#14-the-tensor-logic-dsl)) carries sizes in a *computable* `SizeExpr` mirror, interpreted into `Numeric` only on the proof side (see the note in [§14.3](#143-abstract-syntax)).

### 2.2 `St` — stride matrices

**St** instantiates `ColoredPROP` with `gen = Axis`. Its objects are shapes (lists of axes, whose sizes are `Numeric`); its morphisms are affine coordinate transforms stored as stride matrices over `Coeff`.

```lean
structure Axis where
  name : Option String
  size : Numeric      -- symbolic SIZE (non-negative, ℕ); filled in at configuration time

abbrev StObj := List Axis  -- a shape = an ordered list of axes
```

A morphism `dom → cod` is a matrix `Λ ∈ Coeff^{|cod|×|dom|}` of signed coefficients plus a bias vector, with row `j` giving the linear combination of input coordinates producing output coordinate `j`. Coefficients live in `Coeff = MvPolynomial String ℤ` ([§2.1](#21-numeric)), not the size type `Numeric`, so look-back offsets (negative) are representable. Using Mathlib's `Matrix` gives the composition law for free:

```lean
@[ext] structure StMat (dom cod : StObj) where   -- @[ext]: equality of stride matrices is entrywise on coeffs + bias
  coeffs : Matrix (Fin cod.length) (Fin dom.length) Coeff   -- signed (ℤ), NOT Numeric (ℕ)
  bias   : Fin cod.length → Coeff

noncomputable def StMat.id (a : StObj) : StMat a a where   -- noncomputable: Numeric semiring (§2.1)
  coeffs := 1        -- Matrix.one : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) Numeric
  bias _ := 0

noncomputable def StMat.comp (f : StMat a b) (g : StMat b c) : StMat a c where
  coeffs := g.coeffs * f.coeffs                         -- Matrix.mul
  bias i := dotProduct (g.coeffs i) f.bias + g.bias i  -- ∑_k g[i,k] * f.bias[k] + g.bias[i]
```

`Matrix.mul` is `(A * B) i j = ∑_k A i k * B k j`; `dotProduct v w = ∑_k v k * w k` handles the bias update. (`dotProduct` lives in the **root** namespace in current Mathlib — notation `⬝ᵥ` — not under `Matrix.`.)

```lean
-- The three category laws are proved as named theorems (each `by apply StMat.ext`, splitting into a
-- coeffs goal and a `funext`'d bias goal), then referenced in the instance:
--   StMat.id_comp   : coeffs by Matrix.mul_one;  bias by dotProduct_zero
--   StMat.comp_id   : coeffs by Matrix.one_mul;  bias by simp [Matrix.one_apply, dotProduct]
--   StMat.comp_assoc: coeffs by Matrix.mul_assoc; bias by a simp-set normalizing both double-sums
--                     (Matrix.mul_apply, dotProduct, Finset.mul_sum, …) then `rw [add_assoc, Finset.sum_comm]`
-- (The bias of comp_assoc needs the sum-reordering rewrite — bare `ring` does not reach under the ∑.)
noncomputable instance St : ColoredPROP StObj where   -- noncomputable: StMat.id/comp build over Numeric (§2.1)
  gen    := Axis
  toList := id
  ofList := id
  hom    := StMat
  id     := StMat.id
  comp   := StMat.comp
  id_comp       := StMat.id_comp
  comp_id       := StMat.comp_id
  assoc         := StMat.comp_assoc
  tensor_assoc  := by intro a b c; simp [List.append_assoc]
  tensor_unit_l := by intro a; simp
  tensor_unit_r := by intro a; simp [List.append_nil]
  tensorHom f g :=                                      -- block-diagonal, reindexed to Fin (·.length)
    -- fromBlocks is indexed by `Fin _ ⊕ Fin _`; bridge to `Fin (a ++ c).length` via
    -- `(finCongr (List.length_append ..)).trans finSumFinEquiv.symm` and `Matrix.reindex`.
    { coeffs := Matrix.reindex eB eC (Matrix.fromBlocks f.coeffs 0 0 g.coeffs)
      bias   := fun i => Sum.elim f.bias g.bias (eB i) }
  swap          := …   -- SIGNATURE: permutation matrix (Matrix.reindex of 1), zero bias
-- elementality is a SEPARATE `instance : Elemental StObj` (the mixin), not a field here:
--   instance : Elemental StObj where elemental := …   -- PROVED sorry-free (one-hot points)
```

The category laws discharge using Mathlib's `Matrix` API (`Matrix.mul_one`/`one_mul`/`mul_assoc` for coefficients; root-namespace `dotProduct` lemmas + a sum-reordering rewrite for the bias), all over the noncomputable `CommRing Coeff` ([§2.1](#21-numeric); the proofs are `CommRing`-generic, so they were unchanged when coefficients moved from `Numeric` to the signed `Coeff`). `Matrix.fromBlocks` builds the block-diagonal `tensorHom` (reindexed through `finSumFinEquiv` to land in `Fin (·.length)`). `swap` (a reindexed identity matrix) is the `SIGNATURE` field left as an obligation. St's elementality lives in `instance : Elemental StObj` ([the (Elem) mixin](#2-the-base-coloredprop)) and is **proved sorry-free**: a stride matrix is determined by its action on global elements (points) — feeding the zero point fixes the bias and one-hot points recover each coefficient row, so two stride matrices agreeing on all points are equal.

### 2.3 `Br` — free category over broadcasted base morphisms

**Br** instantiates `ColoredPROP` with `gen = ArrayType`. Because there is no single canonical way to compose two arbitrary broadcasted operations, **Br** morphisms are a free list — the analog of `Composed[Array[B,A], Broadcasted[B,A]]` — making all category laws trivial list lemmas.

```lean
inductive DType
  | reals
  | nat : Numeric → DType           -- Natural(max_value)

structure ArrayType where
  dtype : DType
  shape : StObj                     -- shape lives in Ob(St)

abbrev BrObj := List ArrayType      -- a product of arrays
```

A single `BrBase` is the root morphism of **Br**, bundling one base operation with its reindexings (from **St**), input weaves, and output weaves.

```lean
inductive WeaveSlot
  | fixed : Axis → WeaveSlot   -- retained axis: the reindexing selects a value for this axis at each degree step
  | tiled : WeaveSlot           -- contracted axis: the base op processes the full extent of this axis

abbrev WeaveShape := List WeaveSlot
-- per-array slot list; distinct from §5's `structure Weave (g)` (the cartesian-lift factorization datum)

def WeaveShape.targetAxes (w : WeaveShape) : StObj :=
  w.filterMap fun | .fixed a => some a | _ => none

structure BrBase (dom cod : BrObj) where
  op           : String
  degree       : StObj                          -- shared loop shape P
  inputWeaves  : Fin dom.length → WeaveShape
  outputWeaves : Fin cod.length → WeaveShape
  -- Each reindexing is a St morphism P → (target axes of that input's weave).
  -- This is the locus where St lives inside Br.
  reindexings  : ∀ i : Fin dom.length,
                   StMat degree (inputWeaves i).targetAxes
```

The `reindexings` field precisely captures the four cases from the paper — identity, deletion (broadcast), duplication (diagonal), affine scaling (strided convolution) — each a different `StMat`.

```lean
inductive BrMorph : BrObj → BrObj → Type
  | nil  : (a : BrObj) → BrMorph a a
  | cons : BrBase a b → BrMorph b c → BrMorph a c

def BrMorph.comp : BrMorph a b → BrMorph b c → BrMorph a c
  | .nil _,     g => g
  | .cons f fs, g => .cons f (BrMorph.comp fs g)
```

This is the free category on `BrBase`: morphisms are lists of base operations threaded sequentially (`nil` the empty identity), composition is list concatenation.

```lean
instance Br : ColoredPROP BrObj where
  gen    := ArrayType
  toList := id
  ofList := id
  hom    := BrMorph
  id     := .nil
  comp   := BrMorph.comp
  -- nil ++ g = g definitionally:
  id_comp := by intros; rfl
  -- f ++ nil = f, by induction on f:
  comp_id := by
    intro _ _ f; induction f with
    | nil _      => rfl
    | cons _ _ ih => simp [BrMorph.comp, ih]
  -- list concatenation is associative, by induction on f:
  assoc := by
    intro _ _ _ _ f _ _; induction f with
    | nil _      => rfl
    | cons _ _ ih => simp [BrMorph.comp, ih]
  tensor_assoc  := by simp [List.append_assoc]
  tensor_unit_l := by simp
  tensor_unit_r := by simp [List.append_nil]
  swap a b      := .cons ⟨"swap",
      [],                                                            -- degree: no loop shape
      fun i => ((a ++ b).get i).shape.map (fun _ => .tiled),        -- all input axes tiled
      fun j => ((b ++ a).get j).shape.map (fun _ => .tiled),        -- all output axes tiled
      fun _ => ⟨Matrix.empty, Fin.elim0⟩⟩                          -- StMat [] []: trivial reindexing
    (.nil _)
  -- Routing (input i → output π(i)) is determined by dom/cod types and realized by
  -- the Algebra F : C → V; BrBase records the weave shape, not the routing map.
  tensorHom f g :=
    -- Sequential encoding of parallel composition: extend f to act on (a ++ c) → (b ++ c)
    -- by passing c-arrays unchanged, then extend g on (b ++ c) → (b ++ d) similarly.
    BrMorph.comp (BrMorph.extendRight f c) (BrMorph.extendLeft g b)
  -- def BrMorph.extendRight (f : BrMorph a b) (c : BrObj) : BrMorph (a ++ c) (b ++ c)
  --   := augment each BrBase step of f with identity pass-throughs for the c-arrays
  -- def BrMorph.extendLeft (g : BrMorph c d) (b : BrObj) : BrMorph (b ++ c) (b ++ d)
  --   := symmetric; b-arrays unchanged
-- elementality is NOT a field here; it is `instance : Elemental BrObj` (below the `Br` instance).
```

The category and tensor-strictness laws discharge sorry-free by `rfl` or one-step structural induction, because list concatenation is associative and `nil` is a two-sided unit definitionally. Because `BrMorph` is a free list carrying no `Numeric` arithmetic (the `StMat` reindexings ride inside `BrBase` but are never evaluated in composition), **`instance Br` is computable** — no `noncomputable` is needed, in contrast to the `St` instance of [§2.2](#22-st--stride-matrices). With elementality demoted to the [`Elemental` mixin](#2-the-base-coloredprop), **`instance Br : ColoredPROP` is now sorry-free** (its remaining `SIGNATURE` obligations — `swap`, `tensorHom` via the sketched `extendRight`/`extendLeft` — are the only stubs). `Br` elementality is the `(Elem-C)` of [graded_prop.md §2](graded_prop.md): a separate `instance : Elemental BrObj` whose `elemental` reduces (sorry-free) to `brCancelPoint` — the one remaining `Br` `sorry`, the free-strict-SMC normal-form milestone ([§5](#5-weaves-as-cartesian-lift-data)/Prop 8.2 is its only consumer). **Br is elemental** (the statement is true — witnessed by the argument in [theory.md §Elemental Categories](theory.md)); only its Lean proof is deferred.

The two instances embody a complementary split. **St is semantic**: a stride morphism is the *denotation* of a coordinate transform, not a syntax tree, so composition collapses to a single `Matrix.mul` and the laws come from Mathlib's `Matrix` API plus `ring`. **Br is syntactic (free)**: a composed sequence of broadcasted operations is stored as a list with no canonical simplified form, so the laws are free gifts from list algebra; the price is that symbolic reasoning over **Br** pattern-matches the list rather than inspecting one record.

## 3. The seam adapter into Mathlib

The base class above is deliberately lightweight, so its `St`/`Br` instances keep the "tensor = list concat, strictness = `rfl`/`simp`" elegance. But the propositions of [§11](#11-the-propositions-as-generic-theorems) want Mathlib — `MonoidalCategory`, `SymmetricCategory`, `Grothendieck`, `Limits.pushout`, monoidal functors. A single stated **adapter** bridges the two, turning any `ColoredPROP O` into a Mathlib strict symmetric monoidal category.

```lean
-- The bare category is direct and SORRY-FREE: forward the SmallCategory data and laws.
instance instCategoryOfColoredPROP [ColoredPROP O] : CategoryTheory.Category O where
  Hom X Y := SmallCategory.hom X Y
  id X    := SmallCategory.id X
  comp f g := SmallCategory.comp f g
  id_comp := SmallCategory.id_comp ; comp_id := SmallCategory.comp_id ; assoc := SmallCategory.assoc

-- The monoidal/symmetric structure is the *strict* one read off the ColoredPROP data, built
-- DIRECTLY on the category above (NOT via FreeMonoidalCategory.ofEquivalence — that would supply
-- a second Category instance and create a diamond). The structural isos are eqToIso of the
-- already-proved strictness laws, so the category is strict by construction:
noncomputable instance [ColoredPROP O] : CategoryTheory.MonoidalCategory O where
  tensorObj X Y := ColoredPROP.tensor X Y
  tensorUnit    := ColoredPROP.unit
  whiskerLeft X _ _ g := ColoredPROP.tensorHom (𝟙 X) g
  whiskerRight f Z    := ColoredPROP.tensorHom f (𝟙 Z)
  tensorHom f g := ColoredPROP.tensorHom f g
  associator  X Y Z := eqToIso (ColoredPROP.tensor_assoc  X Y Z)   -- strict: associator = eqToIso
  leftUnitor  X     := eqToIso (ColoredPROP.tensor_unit_l X)       -- strict: unitor    = eqToIso
  rightUnitor X     := eqToIso (ColoredPROP.tensor_unit_r X)
  -- tensorHom_def / whiskerLeft_id / id_whiskerRight / pentagon / triangle: discharged from the
  -- ColoredPROP morphism laws (tensorHom_id, tensorHom_comp) over the strict eqToIso structure.
  -- associator/leftUnitor/rightUnitor NATURALITY: §12 obligations (…) — need a tensorHom-vs-
  -- structural-equality transport coherence the lightweight class does not carry; see §12.
  … 
noncomputable instance [ColoredPROP O] : CategoryTheory.SymmetricCategory O where
  braiding X Y := { hom := ColoredPROP.swap X Y, inv := ColoredPROP.swap Y X, .. }  -- inv laws: swap_swap
  -- symmetry, braiding hom_inv_id/inv_hom_id: from swap_swap.
  -- braiding naturality + hexagon: §12 obligations (…) — not implied by swap_swap.
  …
```

This is the hybrid foundation of the proposition/computation separation: everything **above** the seam — the instances and executable defs (`St`, `Br`, `StMat.comp`, the union-find of [§7](#7-the-grothendieck-construction-and-executable-seam)) — speaks `ColoredPROP`; everything **below** it — the [§11](#11-the-propositions-as-generic-theorems) theorems — speaks Mathlib. The adapter *is* the proposition/computation boundary of [§1](#1-orientation-one-structure-one-seam) made into a definition: it is the one place where "what Lean computes" is handed to "what Lean proves."

The adapter is produced **once** and reused by every [§11](#11-the-propositions-as-generic-theorems) theorem; per-instance proof obligations recur, but the bridge does not. The bare `Category` half is direct and sorry-free — it just forwards the `SmallCategory` data and laws. The strictification is the crux of the *monoidal* half: rather than carrying the development over `FreeMonoidalCategory (Discrete O)` and transferring along an equivalence (which would re-supply a `Category` instance and create a diamond), the monoidal structure is read off the `ColoredPROP` data directly, with the structural isos given by **`eqToIso` of the already-proved strictness laws** (`tensor_assoc`/`tensor_unit_l`/`tensor_unit_r`). This makes the category strict by construction and lets a `ColoredPROP` law stated with `=` line up with a Mathlib `MonoidalCategory` whose coherences are isos. Given the morphism-level `ColoredPROP` laws (`tensorHom_id`/`tensorHom_comp`/`swap_swap`, [§2](#2-the-base-coloredprop)), the *bifunctorial* seam coherences — `tensorHom_def`, the whisker identities, pentagon, triangle, and the braiding inverse/symmetry — discharge sorry-free; the *deeper* coherences (associator/unitor naturality, braiding naturality, hexagon) are the genuine §11 obligations left as `…` (see the [§13](#13-lean-formalization-notes) note).

## 4. The core: `DGradedColoredPROP D C`

Everything above is the base on which the actual subject of this document sits. A `D`-graded colored PROP ([graded_prop.md §3.1](graded_prop.md#31-data)) is a colored PROP `C` (the *operations*) together with the data that exhibits it over a second colored PROP `D` (the *index*): a shape map, a lift action, and the distributivity and action-coherence isomorphisms making `C` a right `D`-actegory. The core class collects exactly that data plus the four named laws.

```lean

  -- NB: the leading `lam` is required — without it `act.map ⟨f,𝟙⟩ : X' ⊛ P → Y' ⊛ P` has domain
  -- `X' ⊛ P`, not `X`, so it cannot equal `g : X → Y`. `Weave` (§5) bundles exactly this datum.
```

Each field is a direct transcription of the [graded_prop.md §3.1](graded_prop.md#31-data) data. `sh` is the **shape map** `sh : O_C → Ob D` sending each `C`-color to its underlying `D`-shape (its list of sub-wires); it extends to the monoid homomorphism `sh*` on objects used by the (Sh-⊛) law. `act` is the **lift action** `act : C × Dᵒᵖ ⥤ C` — a Mathlib functor, available because the seam adapter of [§3](#3-the-seam-adapter-into-mathlib) makes `C` and `D` Mathlib categories. Its two specializations are theory.md's lift notation: `[f, P] := act(f, 𝟙_P)` is the **batch lift** of `f` (covariant in `C`), and `[X, η] := act(𝟙_X, η)` is the **reindexing** along `η : P → Q` (contravariant in `D`, since `D` enters opposite).

The four isomorphism fields are the **distributivity** and **action-coherence** isos. `δ` and `δ0` make the lift distribute over juxtaposition — `(X ⊗ Y) ⊛ P ≅ (X ⊛ P) ⊗ (Y ⊛ P)` and `I_C ⊛ P ≅ I_C`. `υ` and `α` are the actegory coherence isos — `υ : X ⊛ I_D ≅ X` (lifting by the unit shape is trivial) and `α : (X ⊛ P) ⊛ Q ≅ X ⊛ (Q ⊗ P)` (composing two lifts; the order `Q ⊗ P` is what makes `⊛` a **right** action of `(D, ⊗, I_D)`). Together `υ`/`α` are precisely the unitor and multiplicator exhibiting `C` as a right `D`-actegory.

The `Prop`-valued fields are the named laws of [graded_prop.md §3.2](graded_prop.md#32-axioms):

- `sh_act` is **(Sh-⊛)**: `sh*(X ⊛ P) = sh*(X) ⊗ P` — lifting by `P` appends `P` to the shape.
- `act_unit_assoc` bundles **(Act-unit / Act-assoc)**: `υ` and `α` satisfy the triangle and pentagon coherences, i.e. `C` is a right `D`-actegory.
- `υ_nat` is **unitor naturality**: `[f, I_D] ; υ_Y = υ_X ; f`. It is a *separate* law because `act` functoriality alone does not force it; the derived Eq. 3 of [§4.1](#41-derived-ev_p-and-eq-3) depends on it.
- `dist_coh` bundles **(Dist-nat / Dist-coh)**: `δ`, `δ0` are natural and satisfy the interchange coherence with `υ`, `α`, and the symmetry `σ` — the lift is a strong symmetric monoidal action in the `C`-variable.
- `broadcast_gen` is **(Broadcast-gen)**: every `C`-morphism factors as `lam ; [f, P] ; ρ` with `f` degree-trivial (built without `act` over a non-unit `P`) and `lam`/`ρ` reindexings assembled from `act(𝟙, −)` and the coherence isos. (The leading `lam : X → X' ⊛ P` is needed for the factorization to typecheck — `[f, P]` starts at `X' ⊛ P`, not `X`.) This is the generation principle that makes weaves ([§5](#5-weaves-as-cartesian-lift-data)) exist.

Note that **(Act-functor)** of [graded_prop.md §3.2](graded_prop.md#32-axioms) (`act` respects identities and composition in both variables, so `[f ; g, P] = [f, P] ; [g, P]`) and **(Sh-⊗)** (`sh*` is a monoid homomorphism) are not separate fields: the first is the `Functor` laws already carried by `act`, the second is built into the definition of `sh*` from `sh`. And **(Elem-C)** is not here either — it is the `elemental` field of `ColoredPROP` ([§2](#2-the-base-coloredprop)), inherited from the instance `[ColoredPROP C]`.

`D` and `C` are **explicit class parameters**, not `outParam`s. This is deliberate: with both free, Lean's instance search needs them pinned for `[DGradedColoredPROP D C]` to resolve predictably (and so that `Br`-as-graded and `Br`-as-index occupy distinct instance positions without collision). The instance-resolution discipline this implies is taken up in [§13](#13-lean-formalization-notes).

### 4.1 Derived: `ev_p` and Eq. 3

Theory.md's batch-lift defining property (Eq. 3) is **not** an axiom of the core class — it is *derived*. For a point `p : I_D → P` in `D`, the *slice at `p`* is a derived morphism family, and its naturality square is Eq. 3.

```lean
def ev_p [DGradedColoredPROP D C] (p : hom unit_D P) (X : C) : hom (act.obj (X,P)) X :=
  act.map ⟨𝟙 X, p⟩ ≫ (υ X).hom                          -- act(𝟙, p) post-composed with the unitor
-- Eq. 3:  [f,P] ≫ ev_p p Y = ev_p p X ≫ f             -- naturality of ev_p (theorem ev_p_naturality)
```

`ev_p` is a `def`, not a field: it is `act.map ⟨𝟙, p⟩` post-composed with the unitor `υ`. Its naturality square at `f : X → Y` is exactly **(Eq. 3)** `[f, P] ; ev_p p Y = ev_p p X ; f`. The proof combines the two `act.map` factors via `Functor.map_comp` (the product-category interchange `(f,𝟙) ; (𝟙,p) = (𝟙,p) ; (f,𝟙)`) and then slides the unitor past `f` — which is **`υ_nat`**. So Eq. 3 is derived (not posited as its own axiom), but it is *not* free from `act` functoriality alone: it rests on the `υ_nat` law of [§4](#4-the-core-dgradedcoloredprop-d-c). The remaining genuine content lives in `elemental` (the points `ev_p` jointly separate morphisms), which pins down the weave of [§5](#5-weaves-as-cartesian-lift-data) — Eq. 3 holds once `υ_nat` is supplied, and does not by itself force the factorization.

## 5. Weaves as cartesian-lift data

The (Broadcast-gen) law says every `C`-morphism factors as `lam ; [f, P] ; ρ`. A **weave** is a witness of that factorization for a particular morphism — and, as [graded_prop.md §3.3](graded_prop.md#33-weaves-as-cartesian-lift-data) shows, it is precisely the cartesian-lift datum of the grading fibration `C → D`.

> **Naming.** `WeaveShape` ([§2](#2-the-base-coloredprop)) is the *per-array slot list* (`List WeaveSlot`, the shape of one wire). The `Weave g` below is a *different* concept: the cartesian-lift factorization witness for a whole morphism `g`. The Python type named `Weave` maps to the former; this `structure Weave` is the latter.

```lean
structure Weave [DGradedColoredPROP D C] {X Y : C} (g : hom X Y) where
  X' : C ; Y' : C
  f       : hom X' Y'    -- base op (degree-trivial)
  P       : D
  lam     : hom X (act.obj (X', P))   -- leading reindex (the broadcast_gen `lam`)
  ρ       : hom (act.obj (Y', P)) Y   -- trailing reindex: act(𝟙_{Y'}, η) composed with coherence isos,
                                       -- where η : P → (degree fitting X→Y over Y'); assembled
                                       -- from [Y', −] and the α/υ isos of DGradedColoredPROP
  factors : g = lam ≫ [f, P] ≫ ρ

theorem weave_unique [DGradedColoredPROP D C] {X Y} (g : hom X Y) :
    Subsingleton (Weave g)         -- Prop 8.2, from elemental + broadcast_gen
```

A `Weave g` records the (Broadcast-gen) factorization of `g`: a degree-trivial base op `f`, a degree `P ∈ D`, the boundary reindexings `lam`/`ρ` (assembled from `act(𝟙, −)` and the coherence isos), and a proof that `g = lam ; [f, P] ; ρ`. It bundles exactly the witnesses of the `broadcast_gen` field of [§4](#4-the-core-dgradedcoloredprop-d-c), so uniqueness can be stated as a `Subsingleton`. Per wire, the shape `sh(color) ∈ Ob D` is a list of sub-colors that the factorization partitions into **target** sub-colors (acted on directly by `f`) and **tiling** sub-colors (supplied by the degree `P` through `ρ`); the permutation relating the canonical "targets-first" order to the wire's actual sub-color order is theory.md's `Ω_w`, recovered from the symmetry `σ`. This is **precisely the cartesian-lift datum** of the grading fibration `C → D` ([graded_prop.md §3.3](graded_prop.md#33-weaves-as-cartesian-lift-data)): a weave is the choice of how a morphism's wires sit over their `D`-shapes, with the tiling part pulled back along the degree.

`weave_unique` (Proposition 8.2) makes `Weave g` a `Subsingleton` — at most one weave, up to the canonical coherence isos. This is what turns `Weave` into a **datum, not a choice**: the factorization is forced, not selected. The proof draws on both the `elemental` field of `[ColoredPROP C]` (points separate morphisms, so the degree `P` and the target/tiling partition are determined) and `broadcast_gen` (a factorization exists at all). Without `elemental`, Eq. 3 would still hold (given `υ_nat`) but the `(lam, f, P, ρ)` factorization would not be unique.

## 6. Mixins: Scan, Route, Symmetry, Para

The core `DGradedColoredPROP D C` of [§4](#4-the-core-dgradedcoloredprop-d-c) carries the lift, the actegory coherences, and the weave factorization — and nothing more. Capabilities beyond that bare grading are added as **composable mixins**: a `Scan`, a `Route`, an equivariance constraint, a `Para` refinement. Each is its own typeclass; an instantiation declares only the mixins it actually uses and pays only for their fields and obligations. This is exactly what keeps the proven core un-edited as the framework grows: a new capability is a new class layered on `DGradedColoredPROP`, never a field added to it, so the [§11](#11-the-propositions-as-generic-theorems) theorems stated over the core continue to hold unchanged at every instantiation. The four mixins of this family are `TemporalGraded` (Scan, given in full below), the `RouteStructure` and `SymmetryGraded` stubs, and `ParaAlgebra` (forward-referenced to [§7](#7-the-grothendieck-construction-and-executable-seam), since it layers on the `Algebra` rather than on the graded PROP).

### 6.1 `TemporalGraded` — Scan

```

`TemporalGraded` internalizes the four additions of [graded_prop.md §3.4](graded_prop.md#34-the-temporal-grading-and-making-scan-first-class) that turn `Scan` from a bare generator into a definition. `L` is the **temporal object** of Definition 3.3 — an `Ob D` carrying the augmented-simplex / `(ℕ,+,0)` length grading, with prefix inclusions `ιₘ : [0..m] ↪ [0..N]`. `restrict` is the **directed action**: restriction natural transformations `act(−, ιₘ) : (− ⊛ [0..N]) ⇒ (− ⊛ [0..m])` along the `ιₘ`, satisfying the unit and composition laws of an action. `iterate` is the **finite iteration** of Definition 3.4 — for a parametric step endofunctor (the per-step inputs ride as parameters) and a length `N`, the `N`-fold iterate and its catamorphism `cata(step)` exist (for fixed `N` this is plain `N`-fold composition; no fixpoint, no natural-numbers object, until unbounded length is wanted). `trace` is the **state history** of Definition 3.5 — codomain `H ⊗ L_{N+1}` (scanl), with the coherence that truncating the trace along `ιₘ` agrees with running the `m`-fold. `lift_fold_dist` is the **lift–fold distributivity** law: for an ordinary degree `P` orthogonal to `L`, `act(Scan, P) ≅ Scan(act(step, P))`.

With these fields in hand, **`Scan := cata(step)` is a definition** over the temporal grading, not a generator posited by hand. Two consequences follow rather than being assumed. First, the **prefix-restriction law is a corollary** (Proposition 8.7): theory.md's law that `Scan_N` restricted to the first `m` steps equals `Scan_m` falls out of the catamorphism universal property `cata(step) ∘ in = step ∘ F(cata(step))` and its uniqueness — it need not be a separate axiom. Second, **`Scan` batches** along any axis `P` orthogonal to `L` (Proposition 8.8): `lift_fold_dist` is exactly what makes `act(Scan, P) ≅ Scan(act(step, P))`, so a batched recurrence is one fold run independently per batch coordinate, and `Scan` participates in the `vmap`/batch strategies like any other morphism.

`TemporalGraded` uses `extends DGradedColoredPROP` — genuine inheritance, not a signed-empty stub — because `Scan` needs the **whole core**: the lift `act`, the actegory coherences, and the weave factorization are all load-bearing. `cata(step)` is built from `iterate` over `act`; `trace` is typed by the lift; and `lift_fold_dist` is a statement *about* `act`, so it cannot even be phrased without the actegory. The stubs of [§6.2](#62-route-and-symmetry-stubs) also `extends DGradedColoredPROP`, but their bodies are deferred — they declare their parameters and leave the fields signed-empty (`…`), because the machinery they need is not yet formalized.

The key obstruction that forces `Scan` out of the weave story lives in the `restrict` field: the directed action carries restrictions along the prefix inclusions `ιₘ`, but **no point-evaluation `ev_q`** for a single point `q : I → L`. That absence is precisely the Proposition 8.6(i) obstruction — `Scan`'s lift couples positions (the output at `ℓ` depends on positions `< ℓ`), so `ev_q` fails to be natural (Eq. 3 fails along `L`), and `Scan` lies only in the image of the directed sub-action indexed by the `ιₘ`, never by points. It is *not* a weave along `L`; Proposition 8.7 is its positive home, and Proposition 8.8 confirms the obstruction is only along `L` and never along orthogonal axes.

### 6.2 Route and Symmetry stubs

```lean
class RouteStructure (D C) [ColoredPROP D] [ColoredPROP C]
    extends DGradedColoredPROP D C where … -- STUB: data-dependent coproduct injection, gate as Para param
class SymmetryGraded (D C : Type) (T : Monad D) [ColoredPROP D] [ColoredPROP C]
    extends DGradedColoredPROP D C where … -- STUB: equivariance via EM-category of T; gated (equiv_unif A3)
```

`RouteStructure` is the second species of the Proposition 8.6 obstruction — Proposition 8.6(ii). Here the reindexing **depends on input values**, so it is not a fixed `D`-morphism at all: there is no single `η` to lift, hence no weave. The generator is a data-dependent coproduct injection whose routing map is carried as a `Para` parameter (the gate). The motivating example is sparse / top-`k` mixture-of-experts ([future_ideas.md §6.4](future_ideas.md#64-stacking-levels-weaves-over-models-mixture-of-experts-ensembles)), where the expert each item reads is `argmax`-selected at runtime.

`SymmetryGraded` is Proposition 8.4's equivariance, encoded via the **Eilenberg–Moore category** of a symmetry monad `T` on `D` (hence the extra parameter `T : Monad D`). It is **gated** on that EM-machinery ([equivariance_unification.md](equivariance_unification.md)): equivariance is reachable for finite groups, but the graded-PROP-dependent parts of the encoding wait on this formalization being in place.

Both are **signed stubs**: the class is declared with its parameters and its `extends DGradedColoredPROP`, but the fields are deferred (`…`) — the data is named, the bodies are future work.

`ParaAlgebra` (the `Para` refinement mixin on `construct()`) is *not* introduced here. It is presented in [§8](#8-algebras-and-construct) alongside the `Algebra` class, because it layers on the algebra — refining `Para(C) → Para(V)` as a 2-functor, with weight tying as passes-as-2-cells — rather than on the graded PROP. It is listed in this section's title only because it belongs to the same mixin family.

## 7. The Grothendieck construction and executable seam

Symbolic axis *sizes* and axis *identity/alignment* are ordinary categorical data on the graded-PROP reading. Sizes are the **fiber of a Grothendieck construction**; alignment is a **pushout/coequalizer**. This section states both, and makes the proposition/computation seam of [§1](#1-orientation-one-structure-one-seam) concrete: the categorical objects are the *specification*, and the executable structures (a fresh-UID counter, a union-find `Context`) are the *implementation* that realizes it.

### 7.1 The structure/data split as `∫Dat`

Strip the numeric content from the `D`-colors and one is left with the **structural index PROP** `D♯` (colors are formal size-symbols, morphisms are symbolic reindexings); `C♯` is then `D♯`-graded ([graded_prop.md §5](graded_prop.md#5-the-structuredata-split-as-a-grothendieck-construction)). A **data functor** `Dat : C♯ → Set` sends each structural object to its set of admissible size-assignments, acting *trivially on morphisms* — data is unconstrained by connectivity ([acset.md §The Grothendieck Construction](acset.md#the-grothendieck-construction)). The **Grothendieck construction** `∫Dat` has objects `(c, d)` with `c ∈ C♯` and `d ∈ Dat(c)`, and morphisms the `C♯`-morphisms with no compatibility condition on data, and

> **`C ≅ ∫Dat`**

recovers the fully-sized graded PROP (graded_prop.md Prop 8.3).

```lean
-- C♯ is the structural index PROP: same connectivity as C, but all Numeric size fields erased.
-- Concretely, `C♯` is built by replacing every `Axis.size : Numeric` with `Unit` throughout
-- `C`'s color type, leaving the shape (list-of-wires) structure intact.
-- The quotient construction: two C-morphisms are C♯-equivalent iff they agree on connectivity
-- (weave shapes, op names, routing) and differ only on Numeric attributes.
-- structuralCongruence C : HomRel C — the connectivity-agreement relation (a Congruence).
abbrev CSharp (C : Type) [ColoredPROP C] : Type :=
  CategoryTheory.Quotient (structuralCongruence C)
notation "Cˢʰᵃʳᵖ" => CSharp
-- `C♯`/`Cˢʰᵃʳᵖ` is notation for `CSharp` — the superscript chars are not legal Lean identifiers,
-- so the real identifier is `CSharp`.

-- The data functor: each C♯-object ↦ its set of valid size-assignments; trivial on morphisms.
def Dat (C : Type) [ColoredPROP C] : CSharp C ⥤ Type :=
  …   -- obj := fun c => { d : C // Quotient.mk _ d = c }; map := fun _ => id  (graded_prop.md Def 5.1)
-- Valued in `Cat` via `typeToCat` (the discrete-category functor `Type ⥤ Cat`) for `Grothendieck`:
noncomputable def Dat' (C : Type) [ColoredPROP C] : CSharp C ⥤ CategoryTheory.Cat :=
  Dat C ⋙ typeToCat
-- Prop 8.3: the structure/data split. Stated as the existence of an equivalence `C ≌ ∫Dat`
-- (definitional `Iso.refl` if `C` is *built* as `∫Dat`; a constructed equivalence otherwise):
theorem grothendieck_split (C : Type) [ColoredPROP C] :
    Nonempty (C ≌ CategoryTheory.Grothendieck (Dat' C)) := …
```

Mathlib supplies `CategoryTheory.Grothendieck` for the Grothendieck construction of a functor into `Cat`; with `Dat` valued in discrete categories of size-assignments, `∫Dat` is a direct instance. The iso `C ≅ ∫Dat` is a per-instantiation theorem in general, but it is **definitional — `Iso.refl` — if `C` is *built* as `∫Dat`**, which is the recommended posture: define the sized PROP as the integral, and the splitting is true by construction rather than by proof.

### 7.2 `FreeNumeric` is the fiber, not a layer

The `Numeric := MvPolynomial String ℕ` of [§2.1](#21-numeric) is precisely the data the fiber `Dat(c)` ranges over. A symbolic axis size is a term in the free commutative semiring on `String`-named generators; a `FreeNumeric` — the Python `UTerm` that names an as-yet-unknown size — is a single generator `MvPolynomial.X s`, carrying no interpretation until indeterminates are substituted.

```lean
abbrev Numeric := MvPolynomial String ℕ
-- MvPolynomial.X s  -- a FreeNumeric: a symbolic axis size, the fiber datum Dat(c)
-- a size-assignment d ∈ Dat(c) picks a Numeric for each structural axis-symbol of c
```

Symbolic sizes — `FreeNumeric` and `Numeric` — are the **`Dat(c)` fiber data** of the Grothendieck construction of [§7.1](#71-the-structuredata-split-as-dat), as categorical as the structural skeleton `C♯` itself. They live in the fiber over `C♯`.

`Numeric = MvPolynomial String ℕ` is the **proof-side** fiber representation: it is chosen so the `ring` tactic discharges the `StMat` laws for free, at the price of being noncomputable ([§2.1](#21-numeric)). The **executable** presentations of the fiber — the DSL ([§14](#14-the-tensor-logic-dsl)) and the acset tables ([§10](#10-acsets-and-the-executable-layer)) — cannot use it directly, because compiled code can neither construct nor compare `MvPolynomial` values. They carry a *computable* mirror of the fiber (a `SizeExpr` inductive: variables, literals, `+`, `*`, with `DecidableEq`/`ToExpr`), with an interpretation `SizeExpr → Numeric` crossing to the proof side. This is the proposition/computation seam applied to the fiber datum itself; the mechanism is detailed in [§14](#14-the-tensor-logic-dsl).

### 7.3 Composition as pushout

Autoalignment (`@`, `Context`) builds a composite from separately-constructed pieces by gluing them along a shared boundary. This is **not** the primitive composition of morphisms in `C`; it is the composition of *open systems* — structured cospans of acset presentations, each carrying explicit input/output interfaces ([graded_prop.md §6](graded_prop.md#6-composition-as-pushout)). It has two stages, and **only the second is a colimit**.

**Stage 1 — interface discovery (heuristic, *not* categorical).** Decide *which* boundary colors of `cod(f)` and `dom(g)` are identified — construct the span `B → inst f`, `B → inst g`. pyncd does this by positional pairing plus shape-based `(name, size)` matching, inserting identities and prepending rearrangements to reconcile arity and order. This step is a **choice**: it is correct exactly when the `(name, size)` signature determines the axis, and a wrong choice silently over- or under-glues. **Nothing here is a pushout** — it is the construction of the span the pushout will act on. The interesting, failure-prone part of composition — where composition actually *fails*, where the design decision lives — is here, *outside* the colimit.

**Stage 2 — gluing (the pushout).** Given the span, the composite is the **pushout** that identifies the matched boundary colors `B` (the cup), computed componentwise over the schema. On the `Axis` component it is a **coequalizer of UIDs** — exactly what `Context` union-find computes; the **canonical class representative is the universal cocone vertex**. Because pyncd chooses canonical representatives, the pushout is taken on the nose, which strictifies cospan composition so that `;` is *strictly* associative.

```lean
-- Inst(C♯) is a finitely-cocomplete copresheaf category; Stage 2 is a Mathlib colimit:
-- CategoryTheory.Limits.pushout (span legs B → inst f, B → inst g)
-- Stage 1 (span construction) is NOT part of it and is implemented separately.
-- Associativity of `;` is the pasting lemma for pushouts, strictified by the
-- canonical-representative choice — no bespoke proof over `Context` is needed (Prop 8.5).
```

The failure mode lives in the *attributes*, not the structure: the pushout requires the size/datatype data on glued axes to **unify**, and "no consistent attribute assignment" is precisely "the pushout does not exist." `Context` handles the `Axis`-component coequalizer; the size-consistency check is the remainder of the pushout. So [§6 of graded_prop.md](graded_prop.md#6-composition-as-pushout) is a *correctness/specification lens, not a composition algorithm*: the pushout explains and certifies what `Context` does; it does not replace it.

### 7.4 The seam, concrete: union-find realizes the coequalizer

This is where the proposition/computation seam of [§1](#1-orientation-one-structure-one-seam) becomes tangible. The coequalizer of [§7.3](#73-composition-as-pushout) is the **specification**; the executable structures (a fresh-UID counter, a union-find `Context`) are the **implementation**. They meet at the seam, and neither replaces the other.

**Fresh-UID counter — `FreshM`.** Constructing a new symbolic axis mints a fresh identity. Python does this with `random.randint` as a construction side-effect; Lean 4 is pure, so the fresh-name counter is threaded explicitly. Compilation can also fail (shape mismatches, missing base cases, illegal contractions), so `FreshM` is `EStateM CompileError ℕ` — Lean core's combined error+state monad (`Init.Control.EStateM`) rather than a bare `StateM ℕ`. This is the *executable* side — it computes identities and validates constraints; it proves nothing.

```lean
-- The executable-seam modules (LeanNCD/Exec/Uid.lean, Traversable.lean) are Lean-core-only — no
-- Mathlib — so they write `Nat`/`Type u` where this pseudocode shows `ℕ`/`Type*`. `DynamicName` is
-- realized as a `String` stub (display-only, §14).
abbrev UID := ℕ

  deriving Repr, DecidableEq, Inhabited

/-- Combined error + UID-counter monad for DSL compilation.
    `EStateM ε σ α` (Lean core, Init.Control.EStateM) = `σ → Result ε σ α`.
    Compilation validates structure (shape mismatches, missing base cases, etc.)
    and mints fresh UIDs, so both capabilities are needed together. -/
abbrev FreshM := EStateM CompileError ℕ

def freshUData : FreshM UData := do
  let n ← get; set (n + 1); return ⟨n, none⟩
-- Constructing a new axis / FreeNumeric runs in FreshM; pure code (composition, proofs) does not.
-- A counter, not random ints: term construction becomes reproducible and testable.
-- UIDs carry no semantic content — only equality/inequality of two UIDs matters.
```

**Union-find — `Context` / `EqClass`.** The `Axis`-component coequalizer is *computed* as a pure-functional union-find. An `EqClass` is one equivalence class — a `Finset` of UIDs together with its canonical representative; a `Context` is a disjoint list of them. `Context.merge` unions a new class with any overlapping existing ones (Python's `Context.append_bucket`); `Context.apply` substitutes every UID by its class representative throughout a term. The **canonical representative is the member with the largest UID** — and *this is the universal cocone vertex* of the Stage-2 pushout: choosing it on the nose is what strictifies composition.

```lean
/-- Decoration pairing a value with its UID — the canonical representative of an EqClass. -/

    target
```

The framing is the whole point. **The pushout/coequalizer is the spec; union-find plus the fresh-name counter is the implementation; they meet at the seam.** The Stage-2 colimit *certifies* the gluing — associativity (the pasting lemma), the precise error semantics ("no cocone" = alignment failure, "inconsistent attributes" = size mismatch), the canonical representative as cocone vertex — while `Context` *computes* it in near-linear time. A Lean development proves the coequalizer is what it claims; it does not re-derive `Context` line-by-line, and pyncd would never invoke a generic colimit solver. The substitution machinery `Context.apply` rides on a `TermTraversable` typeclass — one explicit traversal instance per decorated type — but that, the `WithUID` decoration, and `DynamicName` are display/identity bookkeeping on the executable side, never propositional content.

Unlike the propositional tower (§2–§11, transcribed as signatures with `sorry`), this executable seam is **fully implemented and `sorry`-free** (`LeanNCD/Exec/`): `FreshM`/`freshUData` mint an increasing counter and propagate `CompileError`; `Context.merge` unions overlapping buckets keeping the largest-UID representative; `Context.apply` substitutes UIDs by canonical representatives. It is verified by evaluated tests (`#guard` plus an LSpec suite) — `#eval`/`decide` work here precisely because nothing crosses into the noncomputable `Numeric` algebra. The per-type `TermTraversable` instances for the DSL AST (`AxisSpec`, `IdxExpr`, …, `BrBase`, `ThreadedComposed`) are written alongside the compiler in [§14](#14-the-tensor-logic-dsl).

## 8. Algebras and `construct()`

The algebra `F` (graded_prop.md Def 7.2 / [§7](graded_prop.md#7-algebras-construct-and-the-para-refinement)) is the strong symmetric monoidal, `D`-equivariant functor `C → V` into a target actegory — the categorical content of `ConstructedModule.construct()`. It is the last layer of the tower, and the clearest instance of the doc's recurring shape: a typeclass parameterised by the classes below it. The target `V` is itself a right `D`-actegory parameterised by a value semiring `R` (graded_prop.md Def 7.1); the algebra is parametric on both the source graded PROP `C`, the target `V`, and `R`. The coherence/monoidal/equivariance/`Para` laws are all **stated** (signatures + `sorry`, math-tower style); only the `Mat ℝ` instance proofs are deferred.

**V as SMC: mathematical guarantees vs. executable compilation.** V being a symmetric monoidal category is required for the *mathematical* content of the framework — F must be a strong symmetric monoidal functor (a morphism of PROPs) for the equivariance theorems (Prop 8.4), compiler-pass correctness, and the Para characterization of weight tying to hold. Without V being an SMC, F cannot be a well-defined PROP morphism. However, V's SMC structure is not required for the *executable* compilation path. The DSL → `ThreadedComposed` → `DenseTensor` evaluation pipeline (`LeanNCD/DSL/`, `LeanNCD/Eval/`) runs entirely on concrete Float arrays and never touches V or F; it is fully sorry-free independently of the math tower. The bridge between the two sides — the formal proof that the executable evaluator agrees with F on concrete programs — is `Bridge/Realize.lean` (currently sorry'd; see [§9](#9-the-mathexecution-seam)). This is the proposition/computation seam in action: the SMC structure on V is load-bearing for the theorems, not the computation.

**Why V needs a D-action.** The source C carries a D-action `act` ([§4](#4-the-core-dgradedcoloredprop-d-c)): lifting a morphism `f : X → Y` by a grading `P` gives `act(f, P) : X ⊛ P → Y ⊛ P`. For F to respect this — "evaluate then lift" equals "lift then evaluate" — V must carry a matching D-action `actV`. Without it, D-equivariance `F(X ⊛ P) ≅ F(X) ⊛_V P` is not even stateable. `TargetActegory` is exactly this matching action on V, together with the coherence laws (unit, associativity, distributivity) that mirror those of `act` on C.

```lean

Their further interpretation lives in the propositions and instantiation sections ([§11](#11-the-propositions-as-generic-theorems), [§12](#12-instantiation-and-future-extensions)) and the lightweight-`Para` note of [§13](#13-lean-formalization-notes); the trained model is a *section of the Para fibration over `∫Dat`*, tying the algebra back to the Grothendieck split of [§7.1](#71-the-structuredata-split-as-dat).

**The `R = Bool` target wrinkle.** §8 turns on the value-semiring parameter `R`: `R = ℝ` gives (`×`, then `Σ`) — the tensor/linear reading, realised over `Mat ℝ = FGModuleCat ℝ`; `R = Bool` gives (`∧`, then `∃`) — the predicate/relational reading. The wrinkle is *semantic*, not typechecking: the predicate reading needs the `(∨, ∧)` Boolean *semiring* (addition `∨` = `∃`), which is genuinely not a ring (`∨` has no additive inverse). But Mathlib's `Bool` *type* carries the Boolean *ring* (`+` = XOR, `*` = `∧`; via `BooleanRing.toCommRing`), so `true + true = false` and `Mat Bool = FGModuleCat Bool` *does* elaborate — over the WRONG (XOR) addition, not `∨`/`∃`. The predicate target therefore needs a separate `TargetActegory _ V Bool` over a relations / `(∨,∧)`-semimodule value category `V` (`∧`-then-`∃` Boolean matrix multiply, with `Bool` carrying the `(∨,∧)` semiring rather than XOR) — recorded as a deferred formalization obligation. The split is witnessed for now by the idempotency proxy `semiring_choice_split` (`(1:ℝ)+1 ≠ 1 ∧ true || true = true`, using `∨`/`||`, not XOR `+`).

**Flagship + propositions (now in Lean, signatures + `sorry`).** `instAlgebraBrMatR : Algebra StObj BrObj (Mat ℝ) ℝ` is the flagship instance (`Br` evaluates into ℝ-modules; all 8 fields `sorry`). Two propositions are stated and verified by `#print axioms` (each lists `sorryAx`): `construct_correspondence` — the `F_ev_p` law specialized, stating that `F` realizes `construct()`'s ℝ-valued read (plug the point `p`, then contract via the unitor); and `semiring_choice_split` — the Σ/×-vs-∃/∧ split *as the choice of `R`*, stated as a PROXY via additive idempotency (`(1:ℝ)+1 ≠ 1 ∧ true+true = true`) since the `Bool` target category is the deferred obligation above.

## 9. The math–execution seam

### 9.1 Two sides of the seam

The framework has two largely independent pathways that meet at a formal gap:

**The math side** (§2–§8) is a tower of typeclasses stated as signatures with `sorry`. It characterizes *what* the computation is: `ColoredPROP` gives the categorical structure of operations; `DGradedColoredPROP` adds the grading and lifting; `Algebra` is the strong symmetric monoidal functor `F : C → V` that is the categorical content of `construct()`. Everything here is propositional — it describes equalities, natural isomorphisms, and coherence laws. The `sorry`s are genuine proof obligations, not stubs: they assert theorems (weave uniqueness, equivariance, compiler-pass correctness) whose proofs are mathematical work in progress.

**The execution side** (§10–§14) is a fully sorry-free concrete pipeline. The DSL compiles a tensor-logic program to a `ThreadedComposed` — a scheduled, routed DAG of `BrBase` operations with explicit wiring between steps (defined fully in [§14](#14-the-tensor-logic-dsl)) — and `TLProgram.eval` evaluates it directly on `DenseTensor` (row-major Float arrays). This path never touches V, F, or any typeclass from the math tower — it runs on concrete index arithmetic and Float operations. Its correctness is validated by evaluated tests and a byte-for-byte cross-check against Python fixtures.

### 9.2 The gap: `Bridge/Realize.lean`

The formal connection between the two sides is `Bridge/Realize.lean`. Its purpose is to realize the computable presentation produced by the DSL pipeline into the noncomputable math tower, and to state and prove that the two paths agree. The input is a `ThreadedComposed` — the scheduled, routed DAG produced by the DSL compiler (defined fully in [§14](#14-the-tensor-logic-dsl)). Its obligation is to define:

```lean
def realize : ThreadedComposed → BrMorph dom cod
```

and state the agreement theorem that the abstract semantics (`F.map (realize prog)`, the morphism-level action of the algebra functor `F : Br ⥤ Mat ℝ`) agrees with the concrete evaluator (`TLProgram.eval`, defined fully in [§14.6](#146-evaluation)) on the same program. The precise statement spans the full compilation chain — the concrete evaluator operates on the pre-route form while `realize` takes the post-route `ThreadedComposed` — but the content is the same: the two paths produce equal results. This theorem is currently a `sorry`'d signature. Closing it requires:

1. **`Br.elemental`** (the `brCancelPoint` normal-form milestone, §2) — needed to prove uniqueness of the `BrMorph` constructed by `realize`.
2. **A concrete `TargetActegory` instance** (`actV` for `Mat ℝ`, §8) — needed so the D-equivariance `F(X ⊛ P) ≅ F(X) ⊛_V P` is concretely defined. This is the actegory: the right D-action on V that connects categorical lifting to concrete axis broadcasting. Currently sorry'd due to the symbolic-size obstruction (symbolic axis sizes have no finite dimension in `FGModuleCat ℝ`; see §8).
3. **The flagship `Algebra` instance** (`instAlgebraBrMatR`, §8) — needed so `F` is concretely defined on `BrMorph`. Depends on item 2.
4. **The `DenseTensor` evaluator agrees with `F`** — a pointwise equality between the concrete Float index arithmetic (which handles axis broadcasting directly) and the abstract linear-map semantics of `F` mediated by `actV`.

Until the bridge closes, the two sides are connected only informally: the DSL compiles to the same operations the math tower describes, but there is no machine-checked proof of agreement.

### 9.3 What V being an SMC enables on the execution side

V being a symmetric monoidal category is not required for the executable pipeline to run — `DenseTensor.eval` works independently. It is required for the *mathematical guarantees* the framework promises once the bridge closes. Those guarantees translate into concrete optimization opportunities:

**Safe graph rewrites.** Any rewrite of a `ThreadedComposed` that corresponds to an equality of `BrMorph`s (i.e. holds by the SMC laws of `Rel`) is provably correct in V via `F`. Two programs related by interchange, braid naturality, or braid involution produce identical Float tensors — no ad-hoc numerical verification required. This makes compiler passes (fusion, scheduling) provably correct rather than empirically tested.

**Operator scheduling from independence.** Two operations on separate wires in the PROP are genuinely independent — the SMC structure certifies it. Strong monoidality (`F(f⊗g) ≅ F(f)⊗F(g)`) maps that structural independence to independence in V, providing safe parallelism annotations for the PyTorch execution graph without a separate dataflow analysis.

**Permutation elision.** PyTorch permutations are zero-copy views. The symmetry condition `F(swap) = swap` means permutations can be commuted through the graph using braid naturality and cancelled by `swap_swap` — all with proof. A compiler-aware of this could eliminate redundant transposes that currently survive into kernel boundaries.

**Weight tying as a 2-cell.** Weight tying (two components sharing parameters) is a 2-cell in Para(V). With the bridge closed, shared parameters in the categorical model correspond to shared PyTorch parameters with a proof of correctness — rather than a convention enforced by pointer equality.

### 9.4 Milestone dependency summary

| Milestone | What it closes | Gates |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `brCancelPoint` normal form (§2) | `Br.elemental`; `BrMorph` is the free strict SMC | `realize` uniqueness |
| `TargetActegory Mat ℝ` instance (§8) | `actV` concretely defined; D-equivariance of `F` | `Algebra` instance |
| Flagship `Algebra` instance (§8) | `F : BrMorph → Mat ℝ` concretely defined | agreement theorem |
| `Bridge/Realize.lean` | `realize` + agreement theorem | optimization proofs, equivariance (Prop 8.4), pass correctness |

The executable pipeline is complete and sorry-free at every milestone. The math tower accrues sorry-free theorems incrementally. The bridge is the last formal obligation before the two sides are machine-checked to agree.

## 10. Acsets and the executable layer

### 10.1 `SBrInstance` as a finite presentation of an `∫Dat`-morphism

An acset instance is a **finite presentation of a single `∫Dat`-morphism**: its `C♯`-part is the connectivity, its `Dat`-part the sizes, coefficients, and datatypes ([graded_prop.md §5](graded_prop.md#5-the-structuredata-split-as-a-grothendieck-construction)). For `Br` the schema is `S_Br` and the instance is `SBrInstance`; the schema, the five entity types (`Axis`, `Equation`, `Array`, `ArrayAxis`, `Sample`), the C-set/attribute split, and the worked encoding are developed in [acset.md](acset.md) — referenced here, not re-derived. What matters for the Lean encoding is the relationship to [§7](#7-the-grothendieck-construction-and-executable-seam): an `SBrInstance` exported via `write_sbr`/`read_sbr` *is* a functor `G : S_Br → Set` — one point of the `S_Br`-instance category, i.e. one `∫Dat`-morphism — and its CSV tables are the C-set/attribute halves of that morphism written separately.

The `SBrInstance`'s four tables become a Lean `structure` whose fields are finite lists, mirroring acset.md's [Lean encoding section](acset.md#from-sbrinstance-to-a-diagram-in-br-a-lean-encoding):

```lean
structure SBrInstance where
  equations  : List EquationRow                 -- one row per Equation
  arrays     : List ArrayRow                    -- Array rows: slot, is_input, datatype_tag, op_predicate, …
  array_axes : List ArrayAxisRow                -- ArrayAxis rows: is_target, position (the Weave._shape interleaving)
  samples    : List SampleRow                   -- Sample rows: (src, tgt, coeff, offset) — the affine reindexing
  axis_sizes : List (UID × Numeric)             -- the Dat-part: each axis-UID's symbolic size
-- EquationRow, ArrayRow, ArrayAxisRow, SampleRow are defined in acset.md
-- (§"From SBrInstance to a Diagram in Br — a Lean Encoding"); see that document
-- for the full field lists. SBrInstance is partially specified here; the row types
-- complete the definition.
```

The full-fidelity Lean `SBrInstance` is implemented in `leanncd/LeanNCD/Acset/SBrInstance.lean` (`namespace LeanNCD.Acset`), mirroring the Python `acset/instances.py` exactly: `AxisType`/`AxisUID`, `OpTag` (10 variants), `DataTag` (3), `EquationRow`, the 12-field `ArrayRow`, `ArrayAxisRow`, `SampleRow`, and the five-table `SBrInstance`. To be **computable** (so CSV I/O can run — `Numeric` is noncomputable, [§2.1](#21-numeric)), axis sizes use the [§14.3](#143-abstract-syntax) `SizeExpr` and coefficients use `ℤ` (so the sketch's `axis_sizes : List (UID × Numeric)` is realized as `List (AxisUID × SizeExpr)`). This is the structure the CSV path of [§10.2](#102-the-seam-made-tangible) reads and writes.

acset.md interprets this `G` as a strict monoidal functor `D : J → Br` from a finite index category `J` (objects = the program's arrays, morphisms = its equations) into the `Br` of [§2.3](#23-br--free-category-over-broadcasted-base-morphisms), using two Mathlib shortcuts that are exactly this document's choices: **`MvPolynomial String ℕ` for `Numeric`** (so `ring` discharges the `StMat` laws — the `Dat`-fiber type of [§7.2](#72-freenumeric-is-the-fiber-not-a-layer)) and **`Matrix` for `StMat.coeffs`** (for the matrix lemmas). `J` is the *free strict monoidal category* on the equation quiver — Mathlib's `FreeMonoidalCategory` strictified — so specifying `D` on generators determines it uniquely; the functor laws are a consequence. The `axis_sizes` table populates the `Dat(c)` fiber; the `equations`/`arrays`/`array_axes`/`samples` connectivity is the `C♯`-morphism. This `D : J → Br` is the finite, written-down witness of one object/morphism of the `Grothendieck Dat'` instance of [§7.1](#71-the-structuredata-split-as-dat).

### 10.2 The seam made tangible

The acset tables and their CSV serialization are the **executable realization** of the `∫Dat` *specification* — the same proposition/computation seam as [§7](#7-the-grothendieck-construction-and-executable-seam), now in fully concrete form. `write_sbr`/`read_sbr` write the two halves of an `∫Dat`-morphism to separate tables — connectivity (the C-set part: `equations`, `arrays`, `array_axes`, `samples`) and data (the attribute part: `axis_sizes`, coefficients, datatypes) — which is precisely the Grothendieck split serialized. The same `Axis` UIDs appear in the term world's `Weave` objects and in the acset's `ArrayAxis` rows, so any `Context`-mediated unification (the [§7.4](#74-the-seam-concrete-union-find-realizes-the-coequalizer) coequalizer computation) is reflected in both views without a round-trip. The categorical object `∫Dat` is what a Lean development *proves about*; the acset tables and CSV are what pyncd *computes and stores*. They meet at the seam.

There are thus **two ways to populate one `∫Dat`-morphism**, and they are complementary, not rival. The tensor-logic DSL of [§14](#14-the-tensor-logic-dsl) builds one statically, as a `ThreadedComposed` term ([§14.5](#145-semantic-compilation)); `read_sbr` builds one dynamically, as an `SBrInstance` read from CSV tables exported by the Python acset machinery. The acset extraction (`from_tensor_program`) turns a `ThreadedComposed` into an `SBrInstance`, and `write_sbr`/`read_sbr` round-trip that `SBrInstance` to and from CSV — so a morphism authored in the DSL and one read from CSV are the *same* object, and either may be checked against the other. Both routes share the [§7.4](#74-the-seam-concrete-union-find-realizes-the-coequalizer) UID coequalizer and so agree on axis identity on the nose.

This agreement is realized in Lean in `leanncd/LeanNCD/Bridge/`. `Realize.lean` realizes the [§14.5](#145-semantic-compilation) computable presentation into the math tower — `realizeAxis`/`realizeStObj`/`realizeWeaveShape`/`realizeBrBaseP` are `sorry`-free, and `realize : ThreadedComposed → Σ dom cod, BrMorph dom cod` threads the routed DAG (the multi-input/permutation glue rests on `Br.tensorHom`/`swap`, so it is a `sorry`). `SBr.lean`'s `realizeSBr` realizes an `SBrInstance` ([§10.1](#101-sbrinstance-as-a-finite-presentation-of-an-dat-morphism)) as a `Br` morphism. `Agreement.lean` states `fromThreadedComposed` (the `from_tensor_program` extraction) and the **agreement Props** — `realize_fromThreadedComposed_agree : realize tc = realizeSBr (fromThreadedComposed tc)` (full equality of the two realized `Br` morphisms) plus `agree_dom`/`agree_cod` — as faithful, `sorry`-proved statements. So "DSL path = CSV path = same morphism" is now a stated Lean theorem, pending the `Br.tensorHom`/`swap` glue and the extraction algorithm. (Signatures + `sorry`, math-tower style.)

The CSV serialization is implemented in Lean in `leanncd/LeanNCD/Acset/` and is **fully executable and `sorry`-free**: `Csv.lean` is the field/row codec and `Io.lean` provides `writeSBr : SBrInstance → List (String × String)` and `readSBr : List (String × String) → Except CsvError SBrInstance` over the exact five-table format Python's `acset/csv_io.py` emits (same column orders, encodings, and `\r\n` terminators). Validated two ways: the Lean round-trip `readSBr (writeSBr inst) = .ok inst`, and a **byte-for-byte cross-check against a Python `write_sbr` fixture** (`test/Acset/fixtures/`, from `acset.csv_io.write_sbr` on a Python `SBrInstance`) — Lean's `readSBr` parses the exact Python CSVs and `writeSBr` reproduces them identically. The CSV path of "two ways to populate one morphism" is concretely realized on the Lean side and interop-tested against the Python `read_sbr`/`write_sbr`; only the noncomputable `realizeSBr`/`fromThreadedComposed`/agreement *proofs* above remain `sorry` (the data round-trip is done).

### 10.3 Lean tower reference

The table below collects the Lean type names from each layer of the tower, with implementation notes. Inline pointers in earlier sections give local context; this is the consolidated view.

| Lean | Python | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SmallCategory` / `ColoredPROP` | implicit / `ProductCategory` | category and monoidal laws are unstated in Python; paper-level only |
| `Elemental` (mixin) | — | the `(Elem)` axiom, opt-in (not a `ColoredPROP` field); no Python witness |
| `List gen` (objects) | `ProdObject[L]` | Python wraps `tuple[L,…]` in a Term; Lean uses `List` directly |
| `StMat` | `StrideMorphism` | stride *matrix* (`Matrix … Numeric` + bias) vs bundled stride record |
| `BrBase` | `Broadcasted` | base op + reindexings; `Fin`-indexed weaves vs runtime tuples |
| `BrMorph` | `Composed` | free list of `BrBase` vs `content: tuple[M,…]` |
| `ThreadedComposed` | `ThreadedComposed` | routed presentation of a `BrMorph` ([§14.5](#145-semantic-compilation)); the DSL's output. `from_tensor_program` extracts its `SBrInstance` |
| `ProductOfMorphisms` ↔ `tensorHom` | `ProductOfMorphisms[L, M]` | `ColoredPROP.tensorHom` (a morphism) vs a data wrapper |
| `DGradedColoredPROP.act` | batch lift `[f,P]` | the lift action; `[f,P] = act(f, 𝟙_P)`, `[X,η] = act(𝟙_X, η)` |
| `WeaveShape` / `structure Weave` | `Weave._shape` | per-array shape (`WeaveShape`); [§5](#5-weaves-as-cartesian-lift-data)'s `structure Weave` = the cartesian-lift factorization witness |
| `∫Dat` instance (`Grothendieck Dat'`) | `SBrInstance` | finite presentation of one `∫Dat`-morphism |
| `Numeric` = `MvPolynomial String ℕ` | `Numeric` / `FreeNumeric` | the `Dat(c)` fiber; `MvPolynomial.X s` ↔ a `FreeNumeric` generator |
| `Context` / `EqClass` | `Context` / `EqualityClass` | union-find = the *implementation* of the coequalizer ([§7.4](#74-the-seam-concrete-union-find-realizes-the-coequalizer)) |
| `FreshM` = `EStateM CompileError ℕ` | random-int UID side-effect | fresh-name counter + validation errors; Lean threads state explicitly, Python mutates a global source and raises exceptions |
| `TermTraversable` | `deep_reconstruct` | per-type traversal instance vs `__dataclass_fields__` reflection |
| `Algebra.F` | `ConstructedModule.construct()` | the algebra functor `C → V` (full class in the [§8](#8-algebras-and-construct) / propositions development) |
| `DynamicName` | `DynamicName` | display only — see [§15](#15-appendix-out-of-scope), out of scope |

The table's organizing principle is the proposition/computation seam of [§1](#1-orientation-one-structure-one-seam): each type is placed by its categorical role — fiber datum, coequalizer implementation, fresh-name counter, traversal, or display — on one side or the other. There is one tower with one seam.

## 11. The propositions as generic theorems

Every proposition of [graded_prop.md §8](graded_prop.md#8-propositions-the-synthesis-organizes) is a statement about the **core class fields and axioms only**. Each begins with the same generic preamble:

```lean
variable {D C : Type} [ColoredPROP D] [ColoredPROP C] [DGradedColoredPROP D C]
```

and mentions nothing beyond `act`, `δ`/`δ0`/`υ`/`α`, `sh`, and the named `Prop`-fields (`sh_act`, `act_unit_assoc`, `υ_nat`, `dist_coh`, `broadcast_gen`, plus the base `elemental`). Because the only hypotheses are class members, each proposition is **proved once, at the graded-PROP level, and inherited at every instance** — the `DGradedColoredPROP StObj BrObj` of [§12](#12-instantiation-and-future-extensions), the `DGradedColoredPROP BrObj CMod` MoE level, a future `Graph→C`, and the swapped-`D` rows all receive it with no per-domain proof. This is the Lean form of [graded_prop.md](graded_prop.md)'s central promise, and it *is* parametricity over a typeclass: a `theorem` whose only free assumption is `[DGradedColoredPROP D C]` applies verbatim wherever that instance resolves.

| Proposition | Lean statement (sketch) | Mathlib machinery | Per-instance cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **8.1** Lift functoriality / distribution | `[f ; g, P] = [f, P] ; [g, P]` and `[f ⊗ g, P] = [f, P] ⊗ [g, P]` | `act` is a `Functor` (so `Functor.map_comp`) + the `δ` distributivity iso | free |
| **8.2** Weave uniqueness | `Subsingleton (Weave g)` (needs `[Elemental C]`) | `Elemental.elemental` (mixin) + `broadcast_gen` — elements separate, so `P` and the target/tiling partition are determined | `[Elemental]` instance (for `Br`: `brCancelPoint`) |
| **8.3** Grothendieck splitting | `C ≅ ∫Dat` | `CategoryTheory.Grothendieck` on `Dat` | `Iso.refl` if `C` is built as `∫Dat`; otherwise one constructed equivalence |
| **8.4** Equivariance | `F` is `T`-equivariant `↔` `F` lifts to the EM-category of the symmetry monad `T` (morphism of `T`-algebras) | EM-category / `Monad.Algebra`; gated on `SymmetryGraded` (the `T : Monad D` parameter of [§6.2](#62-route-and-symmetry-stubs)) | body deferred — finite-`G` is reachable now, the graded-PROP-dependent parts wait; see [equivariance_unification.md](equivariance_unification.md) |
| **8.5** Composition associativity | composition in `Inst(C♯)` is associative and unital | `CategoryTheory.Limits.pushout` + the pasting lemma | free (strictified by canonical representatives, so the pasting is definitional) |
| **8.6** Two obstruction species | a morphism failing to admit a weave does so as `Scan` (species i, coupled but data-independent) or `Route` (species ii, data-dependent); the litmus is whether the reindexing is a fixed, point-natural `D`-morphism | the litmus is `D`-uniform — phrased entirely over `act` and Eq. 3, no `D`-specific input | abstract litmus free; positive identification of species (i) as `Scan` needs `TemporalGraded` (its `L`), as 8.7–8.8 |
| **8.7** `Scan` as a catamorphism | `Scan := cata(step)`; the prefix-restriction law is a corollary of the catamorphism universal property | `TemporalGraded` (the `iterate`/`trace` fields of [§6.1](#61-temporalgraded--scan)) | free given `TemporalGraded`; explains the affine fast path (step algebra factors through a **monoid** → parallel prefix in `O(log N)`) |
| **8.8** `Scan` batches | `act(Scan, P) ≅ Scan(act(step, P))` for `P` orthogonal to `L` | `lift_fold_dist` ([§6.1](#61-temporalgraded--scan)) | free given `TemporalGraded` |

The inheritance is about the **theorems**, not the instance obligations. When a new `instance : DGradedColoredPROP D C` is declared, the propositions above transfer to it for free — but the instance must still **discharge the coherence `Prop`-fields** of the core: the actegory triangle and pentagon (`act_unit_assoc`), unitor naturality (`υ_nat`), the distributivity coherences (`dist_coh`), and `sh_act`/`broadcast_gen`/`elemental`. "Inherit everywhere" names the proven propositions riding on those fields; it does not waive the obligation to *supply* the fields. Each new domain pays that fixed, finite coherence cost once; everything built on top of the core is then free.

In the current Lean transcription, **8.1** (lift functoriality) is *proved sorry-free* (`act.map_comp`) and **8.8** (Scan batches) is a sorry-free re-export of `lift_fold_dist`; **8.2** (weave uniqueness) and **8.7** (Scan-as-catamorphism) are stated genuinely with `sorry` proofs; **8.3** (the Grothendieck split) is in [§7.1](#71-the-structuredata-split-as-dat). **8.4/8.5/8.6 are stated only in prose here, not yet as Lean theorems**: 8.4 needs a genuine equivariance field on `SymmetryGraded` (currently a stub), 8.5 needs the `Inst(C♯)`/pushout formalization ([§7.3](#73-composition-as-pushout)), and 8.6 needs a classification datum — they are deferred rather than written as vacuous placeholders.

## 12. Instantiation and future extensions

### 12.1 `D = St`, `C = Br` — the flagship instance

Today's instantiation is `D = St`, `C = Br`: an index PROP of axis lengths (colors = `Numeric` sizes, morphisms = stride matrices) grading an operation PROP of broadcasted arrays. In Lean the *types* are `StObj`/`BrObj` (`St`/`Br` name the `ColoredPROP` *instances*), so the instance is `DGradedColoredPROP StObj BrObj`; it is `noncomputable` (it builds data over `Numeric`). The instance header supplies the core fields; the named `Prop`-fields are discharged by the laws established in [§2](#2-the-base-coloredprop)–[§4](#4-the-core-dgradedcoloredprop-d-c). `sh` is concrete (`fun a => a.shape`); the lift `act`, the coherence isos, and the laws are the genuine but deferred content.

```lean
noncomputable instance : DGradedColoredPROP StObj BrObj where
  sh    := fun a => a.shape        -- the array's shape: sh([a, A]) = A
  act   := …                       -- batch lift + reindexing (theory.md Lift Operations)
  δ     := …                       -- [X ⊗ Y, P] ≅ [X,P] ⊗ [Y,P]   (batch lift distributes)
  δ0    := …                       -- [I, P] ≅ I
  υ     := …                       -- [X, I_St] ≅ X   (grading by the unit shape is trivial)
  α     := …                       -- [[X,P],Q] ≅ [X, Q ⊗ P]
  sh_act         := …              -- (Sh-⊛): sh*([X,P]) = sh*(X) ⊗ P
  act_unit_assoc := …              -- actegory triangle + pentagon, by St affine-stride algebra
  υ_nat          := …              -- unitor naturality, by the batch-lift defn
  dist_coh       := …              -- δ/δ0 naturality + interchange, from the batch-lift defn
  broadcast_gen  := …              -- every Br morphism factors as lam ; [f,P] ; ρ (Def 13)
-- elementality is a separate `instance : Elemental BrObj` (the (Elem) mixin), reducing to brCancelPoint
```

| Core field | pyncd realization |
| --- | --- |
| `sh` | `sh([a, A]) = A` — the array's shape ([theory.md §Objects in Br](theory.md#objects-in-br)) |
| `act` | the batch lift `[f, P]` + object/morphism reindexing + broadcasted-stride lift ([theory.md §Lift Operations](theory.md#lift-operations)) |
| `δ` | `[X ⊗ Y, P] = [X,P] ⊗ [Y,P]` ([theory.md §Batch Lift](theory.md#batch-lift-f-p-def-11)) |
| `δ0` | `[I, P] ≅ I` — lifting the monoidal unit is trivial |
| `υ` | `[X, I_St] ≅ X` — grading by the unit (empty) shape is the identity reindexing |
| `α` | `[[X,P],Q] ≅ [X, Q ⊗ P]` — nested lifts compose the batch shapes |
| `sh_act` | `(Sh-⊛)`: a lifted array's shape is the base shape tensored with the batch shape `P` |
| `act_unit_assoc` | actegory triangle/pentagon, discharged by `St`'s affine-stride matrix algebra (`Matrix.mul_assoc` + `ring`) |
| `υ_nat` | unitor naturality `[f, I_St] ; υ_Y = υ_X ; f`, from the batch-lift definition |
| `dist_coh` | `δ`/`δ0` naturality and interchange with `υ`/`α`/swap, from the batch-lift definition |
| `broadcast_gen` | `(Broadcast-gen)`: every `Br` morphism is a broadcasted operation ([theory.md §Broadcasting](theory.md#broadcasting)) |
| `Elemental BrObj` (mixin) | `Br` is elemental ([theory.md §Elemental Categories](theory.md#elemental-categories)) — opt-in mixin instance, reduces to `brCancelPoint` (deferred) |

Every row is a definitional unfolding of the core with `D := St`, `C := Br`. With the instance in place, all of [§11](#11-the-propositions-as-generic-theorems) holds for `Br` with no `Br`-specific proof.

### 12.2 The additive-extension menu

The framework grows by **adding instances and mixins**, never by editing the proven core. Each direction below is one or the other.

| unbounded recurrence | corecursion / coalgebra refinement of `TemporalGraded` — the `cata`/`ana` companion | **new mixin** |

No row is a core edit: a new domain is a new `instance` (it supplies the core fields and discharges the coherence obligations of [§11](#11-the-propositions-as-generic-theorems)), and a new capability is a new mixin layered on top (`extends DGradedColoredPROP`, or `extends Algebra` for `ParaAlgebra`). The classification of [graded_prop.md §8.6](graded_prop.md#8-propositions-the-synthesis-organizes) is `D`-uniform, so every swap-`D` row inherits the same weave-vs-`Scan`-vs-`Route` decision procedure.

The MoE level deserves a specific word, because it is the one place the same category `Br` (type `BrObj`) appears twice. The vertical stack `D = Br` reuses **all** of [§11](#11-the-propositions-as-generic-theorems) with zero new proof, and this is not a coincidence — it is forced by the instance-resolution discipline. `Br`-as-graded — the `DGradedColoredPROP StObj BrObj` instance of [§12.1](#121-d--st-c--br--the-flagship-instance) — occupies the **`C` position** of `DGradedColoredPROP`. `Br`-as-index — the `[ColoredPROP BrObj]` argument of `instance : DGradedColoredPROP BrObj CMod` — occupies the **`D` position**. The two are different parameter slots of the class, so the two roles of `Br` never collide in instance search: declaring `DGradedColoredPROP BrObj CMod` does not overlap or shadow `DGradedColoredPROP StObj BrObj`. Because the [§11](#11-the-propositions-as-generic-theorems) theorems are generic in both `D` and `C`, they fire for `DGradedColoredPROP BrObj CMod` the instant it resolves, exactly as they fire for `DGradedColoredPROP StObj BrObj` — the MoE level is new data, not new mathematics.

## 13. Lean formalization notes

The strategy of [graded_prop.md §10](graded_prop.md#10-lean-formalization-notes) reads as a Mathlib shopping list, and most of the tower lands on existing `CategoryTheory.*` machinery. The base colored PROP and the seam adapter ([§2](#2-the-base-coloredprop)–[§3](#3-the-seam-adapter-into-mathlib)) are `CategoryTheory.MonoidalCategory` / `SymmetricCategory` over `FreeMonoidalCategory (Discrete O)`. The Grothendieck split of [§7.1](#71-the-structuredata-split-as-dat) is `CategoryTheory.Grothendieck` applied to the data functor `Dat'`. The composition-as-pushout of [§6](#6-mixins-scan-route-symmetry-para)/[§7.3](#73-composition-as-pushout) and the associativity of [Prop 8.5](#11-the-propositions-as-generic-theorems) are `CategoryTheory.Limits.pushout` plus the pasting lemma. The `Algebra` functor `F : C ⥤ V` and its morphisms are `MonoidalFunctor` / `MonoidalNatTrans`. The gated equivariance of [§6.2](#62-route-and-symmetry-stubs)/[§11](#11-the-propositions-as-generic-theorems) is `CategoryTheory.Action` / `Rep` / `Monad.Algebra` (the Eilenberg–Moore category of the symmetry monad). And the architecture relations `R` quotienting `C♯` ([§7](#7-the-grothendieck-construction-and-executable-seam)) are `CategoryTheory.Quotient`. The `D`-actegory coherence bundle of the core — the triangle/pentagon and the distributivity isos — is the one piece Mathlib carries only partially (`Action` covers a monoid acting, not a full monoidal-category actegory), so it is hand-rolled as functor-plus-natural-iso algebra; it is routine, not deep.

Beyond the coverage map, several honest notes shape any transcription:

- **Strictification strategy.** Build the Mathlib `MonoidalCategory` structure directly from the `ColoredPROP` data, taking the structural isos to be **`eqToIso` of the strictness laws** (`tensor_assoc`, `tensor_unit_l`, `tensor_unit_r`) already proved in [§2](#2-the-base-coloredprop). This makes the category strict by construction and lets a `ColoredPROP` law stated with `=` line up with a Mathlib `MonoidalCategory` whose coherences are isos, applied at the seam adapter of [§3](#3-the-seam-adapter-into-mathlib). It builds **on** the sorry-free `Category` instance (which just forwards `SmallCategory`), so there is no second `Category` instance and no diamond — preferred over carrying the tower over `FreeMonoidalCategory (Discrete O)` and transferring along an equivalence.

- **Strictness is the real friction.** The monoidal-seam coherences are the *single* genuine difficulty, and they split in two. `ColoredPROP` now carries the morphism-level **bifunctoriality + involution** laws — `tensorHom_id` (`tensorHom 𝟙 𝟙 = 𝟙`), `tensorHom_comp` (interchange), and `swap_swap` (`swap ; swap = 𝟙`) — proved nowhere generically but supplied per instance. Over the `eqToIso` strict structure these discharge the *bifunctorial* coherences of the seam (`tensorHom_def`, the `whiskerLeft`/`whiskerRight` identities, `pentagon`, `triangle`, and the braiding `hom_inv_id`/`inv_hom_id`/`symmetry`) sorry-free. What they do **not** imply — and what currently stays stated-with-`sorry` — are the *deeper* coherences: the associator/unitor **naturalities** (which need a `tensorHom`-vs-structural-equality transport coherence, or definitional strictness of `tensor`, neither available for `List.append`'s propositional associativity) and the **braiding naturality + hexagon** identities. Encoding those as further `ColoredPROP` fields would amount to re-stating Mathlib's full symmetric-monoidal axiom set on the lightweight base, so they are left as honest seam obligations (they are not consumed until the [§11](#11-the-propositions-as-generic-theorems) theorems). Nothing else in the development fights the type theory.

- **Inheritance is for theorems, not obligations.** The [§11](#11-the-propositions-as-generic-theorems) theorems transfer to every instance for free, because their only hypothesis is `[DGradedColoredPROP D C]`. But each new `instance` must still **discharge the coherence `Prop`-fields** of the core — the actegory triangle and pentagon (`act_unit_assoc`), the distributivity coherences (`dist_coh`), and `sh_act`/`broadcast_gen`. "Prove once, inherit everywhere" names the proven propositions; it does not waive the per-instance obligation to *supply* the coherence fields.

- **Instance-resolution discipline.** `D` and `C` are **explicit** class parameters, not `outParam`s. With both free, Lean's instance search needs them pinned, so `[DGradedColoredPROP D C]` resolves predictably and `Br`-as-graded (the `C` slot) never collides with `Br`-as-index (the `D` slot) in search — the non-collision relied on by the MoE level of [§12.2](#122-the-additive-extension-menu).

- **Mixins, not a tall tower.** Scan, Route, Symmetry, and Para are kept as composable mixin classes layered on the core ([§6](#6-mixins-scan-route-symmetry-para)), rather than as one deep `extends` chain. A tall tower would invite typeclass *diamonds* (a capability reachable by two `extends` paths) and degrade instance-search performance; independent mixins let each instantiation pay only for the capabilities it declares.

- **The Para 2-category gap.** The `Para(V)` encoding is kept **lightweight and 1-categorical**: a parameterized 1-cell is `Σ (P : V), (P ⊗ A ⟶ B)`, and the "2-cells" (reparameterizations, weight tying) are carried as an explicit reparameterization *relation* rather than as genuine 2-morphisms of a bicategory. The gap to a full `Para` bicategory is **noted, not paid for** — a full bicategorical implementation would be machinery only the specification uses ([graded_prop.md §7](graded_prop.md#7-algebras-construct-and-the-para-refinement)).

- **Equivariance is gated.** Proposition 8.4's body depends on the `SymmetryGraded` mixin and the Eilenberg–Moore-category machinery for the symmetry monad `T`. The finite-group case is reachable with present Mathlib (`Action`/`Rep`), but the graded-PROP-dependent parts of the encoding wait on this very formalization being in place; the proposition is *stated* now and its proof *gated* ([equivariance_unification.md](equivariance_unification.md)).

## 14. The tensor-logic DSL

A Lean 4 DSL embedding for tensor logic, following the syntax-category + elaboration pattern of the Lean 4 metaprogramming book (ch. 8): a BNF grammar defines the surface language; Lean inductive types give the abstract syntax; `declare_syntax_cat`/`syntax` rules connect them to Lean's parser; value-returning `elabXxx : Syntax → MetaM <value>` functions walk the syntax tree (building concrete AST *values*, not `Expr`s — see [§14.4](#144-concrete-syntax-and-elaboration)); and `TLProgram.compile : TLProgram → FreshM ThreadedComposed` lowers programs to morphisms in `Br`.

The **front-end** — [§14.2](#142-bnf-grammar) (grammar), [§14.3](#143-abstract-syntax) (AST), [§14.4](#144-concrete-syntax-and-elaboration) (concrete syntax + elaborators) — is implemented in `leanncd/LeanNCD/DSL/` and is **fully executable and `sorry`-free**: the entry point `tlprog!{ … } : TLProgram` (Stage 1) parses surface syntax into a concrete `TLProgram` value, and all seven [§14.2](#142-bnf-grammar) examples parse. The **back-end** — the `TLProgram.compile` pipeline of [§14.5](#145-semantic-compilation) and the `tl!{}` compile macro (Stage 2) — is implemented in `leanncd/LeanNCD/DSL/Pipeline/` (the noncomputable `ThreadedComposed → BrMorph` bridge is in `leanncd/LeanNCD/Bridge/`; see [§14.5](#145-semantic-compilation)). The text below marks where the implementation generalized or deferred relative to this design (axis sizes carried in a computable `SizeExpr`, value-returning elaborators, `Stmt = assign | scatter`, general-affine reads, n-ary products/sums).

Compilation is a two-stage process. **Stage 1** (`MetaM`): `elabTLProgram` parses concrete syntax into a typed `TLProgram` value. **Stage 2** (`FreshM`): `TLProgram.compile` lowers the program to a `ThreadedComposed` morphism, minting fresh UIDs and validating semantic constraints via the `FreshM` monad of [§7.4](#74-the-seam-concrete-union-find-realizes-the-coequalizer). The entry point runs Stage 2 at elaboration time, embedding the resulting `ThreadedComposed` as a compile-time constant:

```lean
elab "tl!{" p:tl_program "}" : term => do
  let prog ← elabTLProgram p                            -- Stage 1: MetaM TLProgram value
  match TLProgram.compile prog |>.run 0 with            -- Stage 2: run FreshM at elaboration time
  | .ok tc _ => return toExpr tc                        -- embed ThreadedComposed as term constant
  | .error e _ => throwError s!"tl!{{...}}: {repr e}"  -- surface CompileError to Lean's elaborator
-- toExpr requires: deriving Lean.ToExpr on ThreadedComposed and all nested types (see §14.3)
```

The Stage-1 entry point is a standalone macro — `tlprog!{ … } : TLProgram` (`elab "tlprog!{" p:tl_program "}" : term => do return Lean.toExpr (← elabTLProgram p.raw)`) — which parses surface syntax into a `TLProgram` value and embeds it via `ToExpr`. The full `tl!{}` above additionally runs Stage 2 (`compile`), as described in [§14.5](#145-semantic-compilation).

### 14.1 Quick start: entry points and examples

The DSL is implemented in `leanncd/LeanNCD/DSL/`. Two import paths expose the two entry points:

```lean
import LeanNCD.DSL.Elab    -- Stage 1 only: `tlprog!{…} : TLProgram`
import LeanNCD.DSL.Compile  -- Stage 1 + 2: `tl!{…} : ThreadedComposed`
```

**Stage 1 — parse to AST.** `tlprog!{…}` elaborates surface syntax into a `TLProgram` value at compile time with no lowering to `Br`. Useful for inspecting the parsed AST or writing parse-level tests:

```lean
import LeanNCD.DSL.Elab

private def mm : TLProgram := tlprog!{ Y[i,j] := W[i,k] · X[k,j] }
#check mm       -- TLProgram
#eval repr mm   -- inspect the parsed AST
```

**Stage 1 + 2 — parse and compile.** `tl!{…}` additionally runs `TLProgram.compile` (the [§14.5](#145-semantic-compilation) pipeline) at elaboration time, mints UIDs, validates semantic constraints via `FreshM`, and embeds the resulting `ThreadedComposed` as a compile-time constant. A `CompileError` (shape mismatch, causality violation, missing base case, etc.) surfaces as a `throwError` during Lean elaboration:

```lean
import LeanNCD.DSL.Compile

private def mm := tl!{ Y[i,j] := W[i,k] · X[k,j] }
#check mm             -- ThreadedComposed
#eval mm.nExternal    -- 2   (W and X are external inputs)
#eval mm.steps.length -- 1
```

**Evaluating on concrete `Float` tensors.** `TLProgram.eval` ([§14.6](#146-evaluation)) is a
reference evaluator that runs a `TLProgram` on named input tensors and returns an `EvalReport`
containing the full tensor environment and any non-fatal warnings, or an `EvalFailure` containing
the fatal typed error and warnings discovered before it:

```lean
import LeanNCD.Eval.Entry
open Std

def main : IO Unit := do
  let env := (({} : HashMap String DenseTensor)
    |>.insert "W" ⟨[2,3], #[1,2,3, 4,5,6]⟩
    |>.insert "X" ⟨[3,2], #[1,0, 0,1, 1,1]⟩)
  match TLProgram.eval (tlprog!{ Y[i,j] := W[i,k] · X[k,j] }) env with
  | .ok report =>
      IO.println s!"Y = {repr report.env[\"Y\"]?.get!.data}"
      for warning in report.warnings do IO.println s!"Warning: {warning}"
  | .error failure =>
      for warning in failure.warnings do IO.println s!"Warning: {warning}"
      IO.println s!"Error: {failure.error}"
```

**Test files.** Three files exercise the complete pipeline from surface syntax to numeric output:

| File | Entry point | What it checks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `leanncd/test/DSL/ParseExamplesTest.lean` | `tlprog!{}` | Stage 1: the five [§14.2](#142-bnf-grammar) example programs parse |
| `leanncd/test/DSL/CompileExamplesTest.lean` | `tl!{}` | Stage 1+2: the five examples compile; structural `#guard` assertions |
| `leanncd/test/Eval/EvalExamplesTest.lean` | `TLProgram.eval` | End-to-end: thirteen programs evaluated with numeric assertions |

**Running the tests.** From `leanncd/`:

```bash
lake build   # build all modules (DSL, Eval, Bridge, Acset)
lake test    # run the full test suite
```

### 14.2 BNF grammar

Extends Domingos' tensor-logic notation (implicit Σ over contracted axes, Einstein product) with: axis typing (ℝ/ℕ/norm), tensor declarations, Iverson predicates, nonlinearities with optional masks, affine index arithmetic (Slice/Reindex/Scatter), and temporal recursion (Scan).

```text
-- Layer 1: Axis specifications and declarations
decl        ::= 'tensor'    name ':' shape
              | 'predicate' name ':' shape
              | 'linear'    name ':' shape ['bias']   -- flat axis list, as tensor/predicate
              | 'axis'       name ':' axis_kind ['=' n]   -- declares an axis's dtype + optional pinned size

-- A tensor's shape lists only its axis NAMES (and order). An axis's dtype/size lives in an
-- `axis` declaration; the softmax/normalize reduction axis is marked on the output slot (`m.`).
shape       ::= '(' ')'
              | '(' axis_spec (',' axis_spec)* ')'

axis_spec   ::= name

axis_kind   ::= 'ℝ'    ['[' size ']']   -- real axis;          bracket = size (else symbolic)
              | 'ℕ'    ['[' size ']']   -- discrete axis
-- An `axis l : ℕ = 3` declaration pins a concrete loop/iteration extent that no input tensor's
-- shape would otherwise fix (it seeds size inference); omitting `= n` declares dtype only.

-- A size is a symbolic dimension term. In the implemented front-end it elaborates to a
-- computable `SizeExpr` (§14.3), the DSL mirror of `Numeric` (§2.1 / §7.2).
-- Omitting the bracket leaves the size a fresh generator, minted in Stage 2.
-- '/' is FLOOR division by a literal (n must be a positive numeral, not a name).
size        ::= n                       -- literal (SizeExpr.lit)
              | name                    -- symbolic generator (SizeExpr.var)
              | size '*' size
              | size '/' n              -- floor-div by literal (SizeExpr.div)
              | size '+' size
              | size '-' size           -- saturating Nat.sub (SizeExpr.sub)
              | '(' size ')'

-- Layer 2: Index expressions (general integer-affine; n ∈ ℤ)
-- The implementation generalized the single-term forms below to a left-associative
-- '+'/'-' sum of terms (each term a bare axis_name, a literal n, or n '*' axis_name),
-- so reads like `i+p` and `2*j+r` parse. Symbolic-coefficient strides (`s*j`, an
-- ident coefficient) remain out of scope — IdxExpr carries integer coefficients only.
idx_expr    ::= term (('+' | '-') term)*
term        ::= axis_name
              | n
              | n '*' axis_name
              | '(' idx_expr ')'

-- Layer 2.5: Predicate arithmetic (extends idx_expr with non-affine products and absolute value)
-- Only valid inside bool_expr; forbidden in tensor index slots.
pred_term   ::= idx_expr
              | 'imul(' pred_term ',' pred_term ')'
              | '|' pred_term '|'                   -- integer absolute value (e.g. |i−j| ≤ n)
              | '(' pred_term ')'

-- Layer 3: Iverson predicates
bool_expr   ::= pred_term rel_op pred_term
              | bool_expr '∧' bool_expr
              | bool_expr '∨' bool_expr
              | '¬' bool_expr
              | 'ieq(' pred_term ',' pred_term ')'
              | '(' bool_expr ')'

rel_op      ::= '<' | '≤' | '=' | '≠' | '>' | '≥'

-- Layer 4: RHS expressions
rhs         ::= nonlin '(' sum_expr ')'
              | agg    '(' sum_expr ')'
              | sum_expr

sum_expr    ::= prod_term ('+' prod_term)*

prod_term   ::= factor ('·' factor)*

factor      ::= name '[' idx_expr (',' idx_expr)* ']'
              | '[' bool_expr ']'

nonlin      ::= 'relu'
              | 'softmax'
              | 'softmax'   '(' 'where' bool_expr ')'
              | 'normalize'
              | 'normalize' '(' 'where' bool_expr ')'

agg         ::= 'maxreduce'

-- Layer 5: Statements
stmt        ::= assign | base_case | recur_step | scatter_write

assign      ::= name '[' out_slot (',' out_slot)* ']' ':=' rhs

-- An output slot is an axis name, optionally suffixed `.` to mark it the softmax/normalize
-- reduction axis (at most one per stmt; required when the RHS applies softmax/normalize).
out_slot    ::= axis_name | axis_name '.'

-- l+1 and 0 may appear in any slot position; the iteration axis l is identified by the l+1 slot
base_case   ::= name '[' base_slot_list ']'  ':=' rhs
recur_step  ::= name '[' recur_slot_list ']' ':=' rhs

base_slot_list  ::= (out_slot ',')* n (',' out_slot)*
recur_slot_list ::= (out_slot ',')* axis_name '+' '1' (',' out_slot)*

-- Affine LHS: every slot is a (possibly affine) output coordinate
scatter_write ::= name '[' affine_slot (',' affine_slot)* ']' ':=' rhs
                    ['fill' n] ['reduce' 'sum']

affine_slot ::= axis_name
              | n '*' axis_name
              | axis_name '+' n
              | n '*' axis_name '+' n

-- Layer 6: Programs
program     ::= decl* stmt+
```

**Contracted axes** are implicit: any `axis_name` appearing in a `prod_term` but absent from the LHS is summed over — Domingos' convention, unchanged.

**Coupled scans** require no special syntax: two `recur_step` stmts for different tensor names whose iteration axis (the `axis_name` in `axis_name '+' '1'`) carries the same UID are automatically grouped into a coupled `Scan` (`n_states > 1`) by the semantic compiler.

**Semantic constraints** enforced by the compiler, not the grammar:

- `l+1` on the RHS of a `recur_step` is a causality violation and is rejected, where `l` is that step's iteration axis; look-ahead reads on non-iteration axes are permitted
- Scatter with overlapping writes requires `reduce sum`
- A `recur_step` without a matching `base_case` for the same name is an error
- A `linear`-declared weight must multiply exactly one activation factor

**Nine representative examples** (two exercise predicates; the last two are the transformer, flat and scanned):

```text

Y[i,j] := W[i,k] · X[k,j]

-- Causal masked attention (norm axis marked `s.` + Iverson mask)
tensor A : (q, s)
A[q,s.] := softmax(where s ≤ q)(Q[q,d] · K[s,d])

-- Strided convolution (affine Reindex reads). NOTE: a symbolic stride `s*j` needs an ident
-- coefficient, which integer-coefficient IdxExpr cannot carry (§14.3); the parsed form uses a
-- concrete stride, e.g. `X[i+p, 2*j+r]`.
Y[i,j] := W[p,r] · X[i+p, s*j+r]

-- Upsample 2× (affine Scatter write)

H[j, l+1] := relu(H[j,l] · W_H[j,k] + G[j,l] · V[j,k])

### 14.3 Abstract syntax

Direct formalization of the BNF layers as Lean inductive types. `UID` from [§7.4](#74-the-seam-concrete-union-find-realizes-the-coequalizer); `Numeric` (= `MvPolynomial String ℕ`, [§2.1](#21-numeric)) from [§2](#2-the-base-coloredprop); `FreshM` from [§7.4](#74-the-seam-concrete-union-find-realizes-the-coequalizer). Axis sizes are carried in a computable `SizeExpr` (below), not `Numeric` directly.

```lean
-- Layer 0: computable axis-size arithmetic (the DSL mirror of Numeric)
-- NOTE (computability). `Numeric = MvPolynomial String ℕ` is NONCOMPUTABLE — its `X`/`C`,
-- the semiring, and even `DecidableEq` all resolve through `Classical` (see §2.1). But the
-- elaborator builds a concrete `TLProgram` *value* (`elabTLProgram` returns a value, not an
-- `Expr`), and `compile` runs at elaboration time, and the `tlprog!`/`tl!` macros need `ToExpr`
-- plus size-equality dedup — none of which compiled metacode can do over `MvPolynomial`. So the
-- DSL carries axis sizes in this COMPUTABLE `SizeExpr`, with `SizeExpr.toNumeric` used only when
-- crossing to the proof side. (The integer stride coefficients of `IdxExpr` are plain `ℤ`, which
-- is already computable, so they need no mirror.)
inductive SizeExpr
  | var : String → SizeExpr               -- symbolic generator (was a FreeNumeric, §2.1)
  | lit : Nat → SizeExpr                   -- literal dimension
  | add : SizeExpr → SizeExpr → SizeExpr
  | sub : SizeExpr → SizeExpr → SizeExpr  -- saturating Nat.sub
  | mul : SizeExpr → SizeExpr → SizeExpr
  | div : SizeExpr → Nat → SizeExpr       -- floor-div by a positive literal
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr, Inhabited, Lean.ToExpr

-- `eval` evaluates a SizeExpr concretely under a variable assignment (computable):
def SizeExpr.eval (env : String → Nat) : SizeExpr → Nat  -- floor-div and saturating sub

-- Proof-side bridge: approximates sub/div (not representable in MvPolynomial String ℕ).
-- Acceptable because realize (the sole consumer) is sorry-dependent on Milestone B+.
noncomputable def SizeExpr.toNumeric : SizeExpr → Numeric   -- proof-side bridge only
  | .var s => MvPolynomial.X s | .lit n => MvPolynomial.C (n : ℕ)
  | .add a b => a.toNumeric + b.toNumeric | .mul a b => a.toNumeric * b.toNumeric
  | .sub a _ => a.toNumeric   -- APPROXIMATE: ℕ-polynomial has no negation; b dropped
  | .div e _ => e.toNumeric   -- APPROXIMATE: floor-div is not polynomial; divisor dropped

-- Layer 1
inductive AxisKind
  | real   : Option SizeExpr → AxisKind  -- ℝ axis; coordinate DType.reals (§2.3)
  | nat    : Option SizeExpr → AxisKind  -- ℕ axis; coordinate DType.nat   (§2.3)
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr, Lean.ToExpr, Inhabited
-- The `Option SizeExpr` is the axis SIZE (Axis.size, §2.2): `some s` concrete, `none` a fresh
-- generator minted in Stage 2 (§7.2). The real/nat tag is the §2.3 DType of coordinates along
-- the axis (fixing the assembled array's `ArrayType.dtype`). The softmax/normalize reduction
-- axis is NO LONGER an AxisKind: it is marked on the output slot (`LHSSlot.freeNorm`, below) and
-- consumed by the evaluator / `splitNonlins` (§14.5) directly — a per-statement property, not an
-- intrinsic axis kind (the same axis can be a softmax axis in one stmt and a contraction in another).

structure AxisSpec where
  name : String
  uid  : UID       -- identity key for the Context coequalizer (§7.4); assigned in Stage 2
  kind : AxisKind

inductive Decl
  | tensor    : String → List AxisSpec → Decl   -- a tensor's axes are NAMES only; dtype/size live on `axis`
  | predicate : String → List AxisSpec → Decl   -- Boolean-valued: R = Bool target semiring (§8)
  | linear    : String → List AxisSpec → (bias : Bool) → Decl   -- flat axis list like tensor; roles read from equations
  | axis      : AxisSpec → Option Nat → Decl    -- `axis l : ℕ = 3`: an axis's dtype + optional pinned size
  | iter      : AxisSpec → Nat → Decl           -- #5b: `iter l = 3`: the ONLY way to declare a scan iteration
                                                 -- axis — pinned-only (no `Option`), always `nat`-kinded
```

**All array indices are nat-valued — the `real`/`nat` distinction is about semantic role, not representation.** In the concrete implementation every tensor index is a natural number (`Fin n`), regardless of axis kind. The `AxisKind` tag captures how the axis is *used*, not how it is indexed:

- A **`nat`-kinded** axis participates in *sequential/temporal* structure. The `l+1` successor operation is semantically meaningful — this is a step counter, time index, or sequence position. In the D-graded framework, `nat` axes are the temporal objects of the `TemporalGraded` mixin ([§6.1](#61-temporalgraded--scan)); only `nat` axes may appear in `iterAt`/`iterNext` LHS slots.
- A **`real`-kinded** axis participates in *algebraic* structure — embedding dimensions, spatial coordinates, feature channels. Operations over these axes are contractions (sum over `k`), free outputs (retain `i`, `j`), or normalizations (softmax over `d`). No ordering or successor is implied.

The names `real`/`nat` are inherited from the mathematical framework where real-indexed dimensions participate in polynomial/continuous-analogue algebra (`MvPolynomial`) and nat-indexed dimensions are discrete counters with a well-defined successor in `ℕ`. The parser defaults unannotated axes to `real`. Elaboration no longer produces `iterNext` directly for either spacing: `l +1` and `l + 1` both elaborate uniformly to `IdxExpr.affine (IdxExpr.shift a 1)` (an ordinary affine LHS slot). A later compile phase, `reclassifyIterSlots` (#5b), reclassifies such a slot to `iterNext` — and only then forces its axis's kind to `nat` — iff the axis is declared `iter`; otherwise it rejects the program (`CompileError.scanAxisNotIter`). An explicit `axis l : ℕ = 3` declaration still overrides the default kind/size for ordinary (non-iteration) axes, but no longer suffices to declare a scan iteration axis — only `iter l = 3` does that.

### 14.4 Concrete syntax and elaboration

Following the IMP language pattern of the Lean 4 metaprogramming book (ch. 8): one `declare_syntax_cat` per BNF layer, `syntax` rules transcribing each production, and a `partial def elabXxx` function per category. Where the book builds `Expr` terms, the implementation instead has each elaborator **return the AST value directly** — `elabXxx : Syntax → MetaM <value>` (e.g. `elabTLDecl : Syntax → MetaM Decl`) — interpreting syntax by structural recursion rather than via `mkAppM ``Constructor`. `MetaM` (not `TermElabM`) suffices, since no term-level elaboration is needed; `partial` is required because Lean's termination checker cannot verify that syntax consumption decreases; each function matches with `` `(tl_cat| …) `` quotations and falls through to `throwUnsupportedSyntax` on mismatch. **Surface conventions:** identifiers are read with `x.getId.eraseMacroScopes.getString!` (a bare `getString!` panics on quotation-introduced macro scopes); the scan-step LHS token `+1` is a single atom, so it is written spaced as `l +1`.

The elaborator is pure syntax-walking with no side effects: UID minting and axis unification happen in Stage 2, not Stage 1.

### 14.5 Semantic compilation

The 8-phase `TLProgram.compile` pipeline, the typed intermediates (`LabeledProgram` … `ScheduledProgram`), `ScanStmt`, `Wire`, `ThreadedComposed`, and the `tl!{ … } : ThreadedComposed` compile macro are **implemented in `leanncd/LeanNCD/DSL/Pipeline/` + `Target.lean`/`Compile.lean`, fully executable and `sorry`-free**: the first five [§14.2](#142-bnf-grammar) examples compile end-to-end (the two predicate examples are parse-tested only; predicate *evaluation* — the [§8](#8-algebras-and-construct) Bool-semiring semantics — is deferred). Building on the executable `FreshM`/`Context` seam of [§7.4](#74-the-seam-concrete-union-find-realizes-the-coequalizer), the pipeline consumes `TLProgram` values and produces a **computable, first-order *presentation* of the Br morphism** — `ThreadedComposed`/`BrBaseP`/`StMatP`/`AxisP`/`WeaveSlotP` are `List`-based, `SizeExpr`/`Int`-valued, `deriving Lean.ToExpr` mirrors of the noncomputable math-tower `Br`/`St` types (the same `Numeric`→`SizeExpr` move made for the AST). The bridge (`leanncd/LeanNCD/Bridge/`, signatures + `sorry`) maps the presentation into the math tower — leaf realizations are `sorry`-free; the routed-DAG composite (`realize : ThreadedComposed → Σ dom cod, BrMorph dom cod`) rests on `Br.tensorHom`/`swap` (a `sorry`). The CSV-side `SBrInstance`/`realizeSBr` and the [§10](#10-acsets-and-the-executable-layer) agreement Props are stated with `sorry` — see the [§10.2](#102-the-seam-made-tangible) note. Reindexing coefficients are signed (`Coeff = MvPolynomial String ℤ`, [§2.1](#21-numeric)/[§2.2](#22-st--stride-matrices)), so the presentation's `Int` coeffs realize faithfully (look-back offsets included). The `Stmt.recurMorphism`/`ScanStmt.scanPre` escape hatch is implemented (consistent-collapse: the pre-built `ThreadedComposed` is validated, then routed as a single `op="scan_pre"` step), as is the `ScanAffine` fast path (`route` emits `op="scan_affine"` when the recurrence is nonlinearity-free, so routed scan steps carry `op ∈ {scan, scan_affine, scan_pre}`). **Still deferred:** predicate *evaluation* (the [§8](#8-algebras-and-construct) Bool-semiring Algebra — and with it threading a `DType`/op-semiring tag onto `BrBaseP`) and the `Br` coherence `sorry`s. The signatures below are shown in their implemented (presentation) form; the per-phase **implementation notes** after the phase table record the simplifications.

The pipeline is a typed chain; each phase boundary carries a more constrained intermediate type so that Python-comment invariants become enforced by construction:

```

| Phase | What it does | Key Lean idiom |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **assignUIDs** | Traverses `decls` and `stmts`; mints a fresh UID for each `AxisSpec` via `freshUData` ([§7.4](#74-the-seam-concrete-union-find-realizes-the-coequalizer)). | `FreshM`; `List.mapM freshUData` traverses declarations |
| **checkReadRanks** | For every `Factor.read nm idxExprs`, checks that `idxExprs.length` matches the declared axis count of `nm`. Two sub-cases: (a) for tensors in `DeclEnv`, expected rank comes from the declaration; (b) for external tensors (no declaration), the first read establishes the expected rank and subsequent reads must agree. Throws `rankMismatch` on violation. `recurMorphism` stmts are invisible (their reads are not introspected). | `FreshM`; iterates reads collected from `stmtReads`; `Std.HashMap` for external arity tracking |
| **checkDtypes** | Two dtype invariants: (A) `iterAt`/`iterNext` LHS slots must carry a `nat`-kinded axis (`iterAxisNotNat` otherwise); `freeNorm` slots must carry a `real`-kinded axis (`normAxisNotReal` otherwise). (B) A stmt writing to a `predicate`-declared tensor must have `nonlin = identity` (`predicateNonlin` otherwise) and `agg = .sum` (`predicateAgg` otherwise) — applying relu/softmax or a non-sum aggregation to {0,1} values is a semantic error. Reading a predicate tensor on the RHS is valid (the indicator-function pattern). | `FreshM`; `isNat`/`isReal` helpers; `DeclEnv` lookup for Check B |
| **resolveDecls** | Builds `DeclEnv : Std.HashMap String Decl` (`Std.Data.HashMap`; `String` has `BEq` and `Hashable`). Validates: `linear` weight appears in exactly one product factor; every declared name has a consistent shape across stmts; throws `CompileError` on violation. `linear ... bias:=true` appends a bias-add stmt to the returned `ResolvedProgram`. Marks each name as external (declared) or internal (produced by a stmt) — drives routing. Predicate-typed names are tagged here; the tag tells the Algebra ([§8](#8-algebras-and-construct)) to evaluate that output in the Boolean value semiring `R = Bool` rather than `R = ℝ`. | `FreshM`; validation errors via `throw`; bias stmts accumulated in `ResolvedProgram.extraStmts : Array Stmt` |
| **unifyAxes** | The [§7.4](#74-the-seam-concrete-union-find-realizes-the-coequalizer) UID coequalizer, computed in batch. Collects the `(uid_a, uid_b)` identifications from axis occurrences sharing a name within program scope (Domingos' name-binding, [§14.2](#142-bnf-grammar)), feeds them to `Context.merge`, and applies the result with `Context.apply`. The canonical representative is the **largest UID** — the universal cocone vertex of [§7.3](#73-composition-as-pushout) — so a DSL-built morphism and a CSV-built one agree on axis identity on the nose. The whole program is known statically, so this runs once rather than incrementally (Python's `Context.append_iter`), but it is the *same* coequalizer with the *same* representative rule. | Pure (`ResolvedProgram → CanonicalProgram`); lifted to `FreshM` by `pure`; `Context` / `EqClass` ([§7.4](#74-the-seam-concrete-union-find-realizes-the-coequalizer)) |
| **lowerArith** | `IdxExpr.const` reads → fresh `Slice` intermediate; `IdxExpr.affine` reads → fresh `Reindex` intermediate; affine `LHSSlot`s → `Scatter` (injectivity checked; `reduce = some "sum"` required for non-injective maps). Each is a `BrBase` ([§2.3](#23-br--free-category-over-broadcasted-base-morphisms)) whose `reindexings` field carries the affine map as an `St` stride matrix `StMat` — the locus where `St` lives inside `Br`. Non-zero fill prepends a fill-initialization stmt. Auxiliary stmts are stored in `LoweredProgram.auxStmts : Array Stmt`, not a global. | `FreshM`; `freshUData` mints UIDs for synthetic intermediates; auxiliary stmts in output type, not a writer monad |
| **finalizeScans** | Groups stmts by name + iteration axis UID; pairs `iterAt`/`iterNext` slots into `Scan` nodes; stmts sharing the same iteration-axis UID across names form a coupled `Scan` (`n_states > 1`). Each `Scan` is the `cata(step)` of the `TemporalGraded` mixin ([§6.1](#61-temporalgraded--scan)) over the iteration axis as temporal object `L`; the prefix-restriction and batching laws it obeys are Props 8.7–8.8. `Stmt.recurMorphism` supplies the step morphism directly, bypassing equation lowering for that scan state. Validates: every `recur_step` has a matching `base_case`; `l+1` absent from RHS for the iteration axis. | `FreshM`; pure grouping; `throw` on missing base case |
| **splitNonlins** | Lifts `relu`/`softmax`/`normalize` out of `RHSExpr.nonlin` into a separate composed step. These are genuinely nonlinear, so they are not reindexings (`StMat` is affine); each becomes a `BrBase` op ([§2.3](#23-br--free-category-over-broadcasted-base-morphisms)) whose numeric semantics are supplied by the Algebra functor `F : C → V` into the target actegory ([§8](#8-algebras-and-construct)). For `softmax`/`normalize` the reduction dimension is the output slot marked `m.` (`LHSSlot.freeNorm`, [§14.3](#143-abstract-syntax)); masked variants emit an alignment-permutation step computed from the `where` mask. Stmts with `agg = .max` (`maxreduce`) have `nonlin = identity` by construction, so `splitNonlins` is a no-op for them; the `agg` field passes through unchanged to `route`. | `FreshM`; `freshUData` mints UIDs for nonlin step intermediates |
| **schedule** | Backward reachability BFS from the output name simultaneously determines liveness (DCE) and produces a valid reverse-topological order. Two passes in Python; one here because the BFS visit order is already a reverse topo order. | Pure (`String → List ScanStmt → List ScanStmt`); lifted to `FreshM` by `pure` |
| **route** | Detects contracted axes (present in a `ProdTerm` but absent from the LHS) and builds one `BrBase` ([§2.3](#23-br--free-category-over-broadcasted-base-morphisms)) per stmt,·  carrying the `tensor`/`predicate` tag from `DeclEnv`. The contraction *arithmetic* is not fixed here but at evaluation, by the Algebra's value semiring `R` ([§8](#8-algebras-and-construct)): `R = ℝ` (×, then Σ) for `tensor` outputs, `R = Bool` (∧, then ∃) for `predicate` outputs — the ∃/∧-vs-Σ split is exactly that choice of `R`. `agg = .max` stmts are assigned `op="maxreduce"` (overriding the default `"contract"` for assign stmts); the reduction `(×, max, −∞·)` is then selected at eval time. *Note: this is not the tropical semiring, but supports max contraction often used in deep learning.* Assigns index slots; builds `ThreadedComposed.routing` and `n_external`. Automatic associative-scan detection (nonlinearity-free recurrence, flagged in `finalizeScans`) tags the routed step `op="scan_affine"` — the `ScanAffine` case where the step algebra factors through a monoid, i.e. Prop 8.7's `O(log N)` parallel prefix; a `recurMorphism` step is tagged `op="scan_pre"`. | Pure (`List ScanStmt → DeclEnv → Context → ThreadedComposed`); lifted to `FreshM` by `pure` |

**Implementation notes.** The phase-table rows above describe the full design; the implemented pipeline simplifies several rows (all `sorry`-free):

- **checkReadRanks** and **checkDtypes** are two validation-only passes that take and return `ResolvedProgram` unchanged. `checkReadRanks` uses a private `stmtReads : Stmt → List (String × Nat)` helper (reads only `assign`/`scatter`; `recurMorphism` returns `[]`). `checkDtypes` uses private `isNat`/`isReal` helpers on `AxisKind`. The elaborator (`elabTLLHSSlot`) sets `kind := .nat none` for both `iterAt` (the placeholder `""` axis) and `iterNext` axes, so well-formed programs parsed from surface syntax always pass Check A without annotation. The `freeNorm` check (`normAxisNotReal`) only fires for programmatically constructed programs that explicitly supply a `nat`-kinded axis there. The `predicateAgg` check rejects `agg ≠ .sum` on predicate outputs (Check B is two `unless` guards: one for `nonlin`, one for `agg`).
- **assignUIDs** binds by axis *name* (the parser emits `uid := 0` for every axis), reusing the [§14.4](#144-concrete-syntax-and-elaboration) `traverseUID`; a `freshNonZero` guard skips the sentinel `0`.
- **resolveDecls** is purely constructive (it never throws): an undeclared read name is an *external input* (the [§14.2](#142-bnf-grammar) examples read `W`/`X`/`Q`/`K` with no `tensor` decl), so `extNames` = read-not-produced. `linear`-weight arity, shape consistency, and bias materialization are deferred (no example declares a `linear` weight); `extraStmts := #[]`. The `tensor`/`predicate` value-semiring tagging is an [§8](#8-algebras-and-construct) *semantic* concern deferred to the bridge, not carried in the presentation.
- **lowerArith** reclassifies affine-LHS assigns to `Stmt.scatter` with a conservative injectivity guard (`overlappingScatter` on a dimension-collapsing constant coordinate); affine *reads* are left in place and folded into the consuming step's `reindexings` at `route` (which is exactly where `St` lives inside `BrBase`, [§2.3](#23-br--free-category-over-broadcasted-base-morphisms)) rather than emitted as separate Slice/Reindex steps; `auxStmts := #[]`.
- **finalizeScans** groups by iteration-axis UID into (coupled) `Scan` nodes; a pre-pass makes each base case adopt a same-named recurrence's iteration axis (the parser emits scan base cases with a placeholder iteration-axis name); `missingBaseCase`/`causalityViolation` guards fire; a `recurMorphism` stmt becomes `ScanStmt.scanPre`, and the `isAffine` flag on `ScanStmt.scan` is set here (before `splitNonlins`) when the recurrence is nonlinearity-free.
- **schedule** does backward-reachability DCE; the output root is the last stmt's written name(s) (single-result-at-tail — a genuine multi-output-not-at-tail program would need an explicit outputs field).
- **route** builds one `BrBaseP` per stmt with contracted axes (read axes absent from the LHS) as `tiled` weave slots; each read's affine `IdxExpr` becomes an integer-coefficient `StMatP` via an `idxToRow` translation; inputs are wired to their producer step or to the external sentinel (`step = nExternal`). The `ScanAffine` fast path is implemented as an `op` tag — `op="scan_affine"` when the recurrence is nonlinearity-free, `op="scan_pre"` for a `recurMorphism` step, else `op="scan"` (so routed scan steps carry `op ∈ {scan, scan_affine, scan_pre}`); the value-semiring contraction arithmetic is deferred to the bridge. For non-scan assign stmts, `op` is `"contract"` by default and `"maxreduce"` when `rhs.agg = .max`; for scatter stmts the op string is unaffected by `agg` (scatter uses `opts.reduce` instead).

**Static validation summary.** The pipeline enforces the following checks at compile time, throwing a `CompileError` on the first violation in each phase:

| Check | Phase | Error constructor |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Every `iterAt`/`iterNext` recurrence has a matching base case | finalizeScans | `missingBaseCase` |
| The iteration axis does not appear with offset `l+1` on the RHS | finalizeScans | `causalityViolation` |
| Affine-LHS scatter with collapsing coordinate requires `reduce = sum` | lowerArith | `overlappingScatter` |
| Per-step intermediate depends on at most one scan axis | finalizeScans | `shapeMismatch` |
| Read arity matches declared tensor rank | checkReadRanks | `rankMismatch` |
| All reads of the same external tensor agree on arity | checkReadRanks | `rankMismatch` |
| `iterAt`/`iterNext` LHS slots carry a `ℕ`-kinded axis | checkDtypes | `iterAxisNotNat` |
| `freeNorm` LHS slots carry a `ℝ`-kinded axis | checkDtypes | `normAxisNotReal` |
| `predicate`-declared output tensor has `identity` nonlinearity | checkDtypes | `predicateNonlin` |
| `predicate`-declared output tensor has `sum` aggregation | checkDtypes | `predicateAgg` |

What the compiler does **not** check statically: read-name existence (external tensors have no rank declaration; shape mismatches surface at eval time via `inferAxisSizes`), value-dtype compatibility on the RHS (reading a `predicate` tensor in an arithmetic expression is intentionally valid — the indicator-function pattern), and axis-kind consistency across all occurrences of the same UID (a cross-occurrence check would require collecting kinds by UID after `unifyAxes`, analogous to size-conflict detection in `inferAxisSizes`).

The result is a `ThreadedComposed` (a presentation of a `BrMorph`, [§2.3](#23-br--free-category-over-broadcasted-base-morphisms)) — a finite presentation of an `∫Dat`-morphism, the very thing an `SBrInstance` ([§10.1](#101-sbrinstance-as-a-finite-presentation-of-an-dat-morphism)) presents in tabular form. The DSL path of this section and the CSV path of [§10](#10-acsets-and-the-executable-layer) therefore produce the same categorical object: the acset extraction relates the `ThreadedComposed` and `SBrInstance` presentations, and `write_sbr`/`read_sbr` serialize the latter to and from CSV — none of these steps changes the morphism.

### 14.6 Evaluation

The DSL has a reference **`Float` evaluator**,
`TLProgram.eval : TLProgram → Std.HashMap String DenseTensor → Except EvalFailure EvalReport`
(in `leanncd/LeanNCD/Eval/Entry.lean`), which runs a program on concrete input tensors and returns
the full input-plus-computed environment together with non-fatal warnings on success, or the fatal
typed error together with warnings inferred before that failure
(`EvalReport = { env : HashMap String DenseTensor, warnings : List EvalWarning }`;
`EvalFailure = { error : EvalError, warnings : List EvalWarning }`;
`DenseTensor` is a row-major `{ shape, data : Array Float }`). Callers that need tensors explicitly
inspect `EvalReport.env` after handling both outcomes; there is no warning-dropping output-only
entry point. The evaluator is fully executable and `sorry`-free.

The evaluator interprets the **pre-route `ScheduledProgram`** rather than the routed
`ThreadedComposed` of [§14.5](#145-semantic-compilation): the routed presentation keeps only a scan's
representative recurrence step (it is lossy for scans), whereas the `ScheduledProgram` retains the full
`base`/`recur` stmt lists, so coupled and base cases evaluate. The output **dtype** (tensor vs
predicate) is read from the decls and the `RHSExpr.agg` field via a `Combine` structure
`{ mul, combine, unit0 }` that packages the three semiring operators:

- **`Combine.real`** `(×, Σ, 0)` — standard tensor contraction (`R = ℝ`)
- **`Combine.bool`** `(min, max, 0.0)` — Boolean `(∧, ∃)` contraction on 0/1 Floats (`R = Bool`); selected for `predicate`-declared outputs
- **`Combine.max`** `(×, max, −∞)` — max contraction (not tropical semiring); selected when `agg = .max` (`maxreduce`). Identity `−∞` (IEEE 754 `−1.0/0.0`) ensures all-negative inputs reduce to the true maximum rather than `0`.

`combineFor` chooses: `agg = .max` → `Combine.max`; else `predicate` → `Combine.bool`; else `Combine.real`. This sidesteps the deferred `BrBaseP` dtype gap. All thirteen
example programs (the seven §14.2/predicate examples plus look-back, outer product, contraction+relu,
normalize, and unrolled/scan transformer examples) evaluate with hand-checked numeric assertions in `test/Eval/EvalExamplesTest.lean`;
max-reduction programs are tested in `test/DSL/MaxReduceTest.lean`.
Symbolic-size evaluation and the `scanPre`/`recurMorphism` escape hatches are out of scope (they raise
an `EvalError`).

**Axis size inference.** The evaluator needs concrete sizes for every free axis before it can
allocate output tensors or index into inputs. The naive approach — requiring users to declare every
axis size explicitly — breaks ML programs where the output shape is a derived consequence of the
input shapes and the affine read pattern. A strided convolution `Y[h] := W[k] · X[2h+k-1]` has
no fixed output size: `h` depends jointly on the kernel width (`k`, inferred from `W`'s shape) and
the input width (from `X`'s shape), via two coupled constraints. An outer-product program
`Y[i,j] := X[i+j] + U[i+2j]` must solve a 2×2 linear system over the free axes `i` and `j`.
Neither is determined by any single tensor dimension in isolation.

`evalScheduled` therefore calls
`inferAxisSizes : HashMap UID Nat → HashMap String DenseTensor → List Stmt → Except EvalFailure
(HashMap UID Nat × List EvalWarning)` (in `leanncd/LeanNCD/Eval/SizeInfer.lean`) to derive the
concrete size of every free axis from the shapes of the supplied input tensors. Success returns the
solved size map and structured warnings; failure returns the typed fatal error together with any
warnings discovered before it. The solver works in three stages:

1. **Upper-envelope projection.** Each affine read position (an `AffinePosition` carrying the
   tensor name, dimension, constant offset, and coefficient list) is filtered to its
   *upper-envelope coefficients*: only the positive-coefficient terms can reach their axis maximum
   under padded semantics, so only those terms constrain the size. Negative coefficients are
   dropped from the size equation (they remain valid for evaluation — e.g. the `−i` in `X[3−i]`
   never reaches a maximum along `i`). A bare read `X[3−i]` with only a negative coefficient on
   `i` is flagged after fixpoint as *purely negatively constrained* (see stage 3).

2. **Unified RREF solver (`solveSizeConstraints`).** All read positions with at least one unsized
   axis are collected as `SizeConstraint` records and passed to a single Gaussian elimination over
   `Rat`. The constraint RHS follows the *maximal-extent convention*: for a read `T[c₀ + Σ cᵢ·aᵢ]` against
   a tensor of dimension `d`, the constraint is
   `Σ_{cᵢ>0} cᵢ · size(aᵢ) = d − c₀ + Σ_{cᵢ>0} cᵢ − 1`,
   which places the maximum index exactly at `d − 1` (tight fit). Non-integral RREF solutions are
   floored independently (*floor-then-verify*): after flooring, every original constraint is
   re-checked as an inequality (`lhs ≤ rhs`); a violation returns a descriptive `EvalFailure`. This
   handles padded-access programs such as strided convolution, where the exact system is
   non-integral but the floored solution still satisfies the inequality bounds.

3. **Fixpoint + diagnostics.** The solver iterates until no new size is discovered. After
   convergence, two checks run:
   - *Purely negatively constrained axes (fail-loud):* any axis whose upper-envelope coefficient
     is non-positive in every read — meaning no constraint can bound it from above — throws an
     `EvalError` citing the axis UID and source positions. Such axes must be declared explicitly
     (`axis a = n`).
   - *Padded-access warning:* any fully-known multi-term read (all axes already sized) whose
     maximum index meets or exceeds the tensor dimension emits
     `EvalWarning.paddedAccess source maxIndex dimension`. Under padded semantics out-of-range
     reads return zero and are valid, but the warning flags the access as potentially surprising.
     `evalScheduled` preserves the warning in `EvalReport` on success or `EvalFailure` if a later
     inference/execution step fails; it never prints diagnostics via tracing. This warning fires
     only when axis sizes arrive via the explicit seed argument, because solver-derived sizes are
     tight-fit by construction (max-index = dim − 1) and can never trigger it.

**What the solver infers.** A few representative cases:

| Program | Inputs | Inferred |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Y[i,j] := X[i+j] + U[i+2j]` | X:[7], U:[9] | i=5, j=3 (solve `i+j=8`, `i+2j=11`) |
| `Y[h] := W[k] · X[2h+k-1]` | W:[3], X:[8] | k=3, h=4 (solve `k=3`, `2h+k=11`) |
| `Y[h] := W[k] · X[2h+k-1]` | W:[3], X:[7] | k=3, h=3 (floor: `2h+k=10`, h=3.5→3; verify 6+3=9≤10 ✓) |
| `Y[i,j,k] := X[2i+j+3k] · U[3k] · V[i+2j]` | X:[14], U:[8], V:[10] | i=2, j=5, k=3 (joint RREF then floor k=10/3→3; verify all ✓) |
| `Y[i] := X[i+2]` | X:[8] | i=6 (solve `i = 8−2+1−1 = 6`; max-index 2+5=7=8−1 ✓) |
| `Y[i,j] := X[i+j]` | X:[7] | **error**: underdetermined (rank 1, 2 unknowns) |
| `Y[i,j] := X[i+j]` (with `axis i = 3`) | X:[7] | i=3 (seed), j=5 (seed resolves underdetermined case) |
| `Y[i] := A[i] + B[i]` | A:[4], B:[6] | **error**: conflict (i=4 from A, i=6 from B) |
| `Y[i] := X[3-i]` | X:[5] | **error**: axis i purely negatively constrained |
| `Y[i] := X[3-i]` (with `axis i = 4`) | X:[5] | i=4 (seed bypasses solver) |

`inferAxisSizes` is tested in `test/Eval/AffineShapeSolverTest.lean` (multi-equation, conv-like,
non-integral floor, signed-affine, 2D/3D padded-window, mixed-path, redundant-equality,
purely-negatively-constrained, seeded, three-variable joint-solve, padded-access warning) and the
corresponding semantics are documented in
`docs/lean_affine_shape_solver_max_padded_semantics.md`.

## 15. Appendix: out of scope

Two families of structure are deliberately **not encoded**, because they carry no propositional or computational content the framework reasons about. The first is **`DynamicName` and its LaTeX rendering** — the human-readable, mathematically-typeset names attached to axes and arrays. The second is the **`Block` display metadata** — the layout and presentation bookkeeping the visualizer consumes. Both are *semantically transparent*: erasing them changes no morphism, no shape, no composite, and no proof. They ride on the executable side of the seam as identity/display decoration (the `WithUID` decoration of [§7.4](#74-the-seam-concrete-union-find-realizes-the-coequalizer) carries the optional `DynamicName`), and they are left exactly where the current document already leaves `Block` — outside the encoding, mentioned but never formalized.

This matches the document's overall stance, restated once here: it writes **no proved Lean**. Every `class`, `structure`, `def`, and `theorem` above is a *signature* with named `Prop`-field laws and named proof obligations; the elisions (`…`) in bodies are intentional, marking exactly the obligations a future Lean development would discharge. The deliverable is **formalizability, not formalization** — the shape into which the propositions of [graded_prop.md §8](graded_prop.md#8-propositions-the-synthesis-organizes) transcribe directly, not the discharged proofs themselves.
