# Bounded-exhaustive generator of well-formed scan-free programs (Task 3, E6)

`enumPrograms` is a finite list of `(TLProgram, inputs)` pairs, each a well-formed
scan-free program paired with a deterministic input env covering exactly its input
tensors. "Well-formed" here means: every read names a declared tensor with the
right arity, every axis is declared with a concrete pinned size, and the input env
provides a `DenseTensor` for every input tensor name with `shape`/`data` matching
the declared axis sizes. Contract test (2) below is the load-bearing check: EVERY
generated program must compile (`compileToScheduled`) AND evaluate to `.ok` — that
is what makes this a trustworthy source of baselines for property-based oracles.

/-! ## Y-dependent 2-statement programs (Task 5, E6 review — the key reordering fix)

The `two` programs above are INDEPENDENT (`Y := f(A,B); Z := g(A,B)`): permuting them to
`[Z; Y]` still evaluates identically, so `checkLaws`'s reordering law never exercises real
reordering. `yDepPrograms` instead builds `Y := f(A,B); Z := g(...Y...)` where `Z`'s RHS READS
the tensor `Y` produced by the first statement — a genuine producer→consumer dependency.
Permuting the statement list to `[Z; Y]` now forces `schedule`/`topoSort`
(`LeanNCD/DSL/Pipeline/Lowering.lean`) to reorder producer-before-consumer to get the same
answer, so the reordering law does real work on these programs. -/

/-! ## A genuine-contraction program (Task 5 — exercises materialization beyond the linear/sum
fragment, and puts the previously-unused `j` axis to work)

`C[i] := P[i,j]` (`agg := .sum`) reads the 2-D input `P` over both `i` and `j`, but its LHS
only retains `i` — `j` is CONTRACTED (summed away), matching the Route phase's own definition
(`Lowering.lean`: "Contracted axes = read axes whose uid is NOT among the LHS axis uids"). -/

/-! ## A multi-term contraction program (Task 5b — materialization must bite on a CONTRACTING
statement)

`contractPrograms` above are all SINGLE-term (`C[i] := P[i,j]`), so `materializeSplit`
(`terms.length ≥ 2` is its split trigger, `Transforms.lean`) never touches them — materialization
was never exercised on a contracting statement. `contractMultiTermPrograms` fixes this:
`C[i] := P[i,j] + A[i]` has TWO terms — `P[i,j]` contracts `j` (read but absent from the LHS
`[i]`), `A[i]` is a plain read — so `materializeSplit` splits it into `T0[i] := P[i,j]` (itself a
contracting statement) and `T1[i] := A[i]`, summed. -/

    same output index). -/
