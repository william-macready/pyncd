/-! ## Phase 6 — `splitNonlins`

For each `Stmt` whose `RHSExpr.nonlin ≠ .identity`, split it into TWO stmts:
1. a LINEAR step computing the pre-activation into a fresh intermediate tensor
   (`nonlin := .identity`, original body, same LHS slots); and
2. a NONLIN step that READS that intermediate at the output's own coordinates and carries
   the original nonlinearity (and its mask).
A stmt already at `.identity` is emitted unchanged. -/

/-- Axis indices that index the output of a stmt (its free/scan slots). An `.affine` slot is a
    scatter output; `lowerArith` (Structural.lean) reclassifies every `slotsBecomeScatter`
    `.assign` into `Stmt.scatter` before this phase runs, so no `.assign` carrying an `.affine`
    slot can reach `splitStmt` at all — unreachable from `splitStmt` post-`lowerArith`; kept
    total for exhaustiveness. -/

  | .iterAt a _ => some (.axis a)
  | .iterNext a => some (.axis a)
  | .affine _   => none      -- scatter outputs: skipped (see doc above)

/-- Split one stmt's nonlinearity into (≤2) stmts. Identity stmts and scatters pass through
    unchanged. Scatters are a `.identity`-only shape by this point: `checkScatterNonlin`
    (Structural.lean, a Spike-3 Stage-0 SHORT-TERM policy — not permanent) rejects any
    `.scatter`/affine-LHS `.assign` with a non-identity nonlinearity upstream, in validation,
    before `lowerArith` reclassifies an affine-LHS `.assign` into `Stmt.scatter` — so nothing
    reaches this arm needing a split. (Supporting a real nonlinear scatter later needs a semantic
    decision — activation before collision-reduction, or after fill/reduce? — deferred.) -/

        -- step doesn't reduce anything, doesn't read the marker, and neither `resolveNonlin`
        -- (`Eval/Nonlin.lean`) nor the contraction evaluator ever inspects it on an `.identity`

/-! ## Phase 7 — `schedule`

Ordering only; no statement pruning (KG-multiout: every produced name may be an intended
output, so the scheduler keeps all top-level statements and lets the caller ignore unwanted
keys). Statements are topologically sorted so producers precede their consumers.
Never-read *external* input names are still dropped (`liveExtNames`). -/

/-! ### Topological sort (stable Kahn's algorithm)

`topoSortFuel` repeatedly emits the first currently-eligible statement — one whose
internal-read dependencies are all already emitted — scanning `remaining` in source order
on each pass to get a stable, no-op-on-already-sorted output.

An **internal dependency** is a read name that some stmt in the full list writes.
**Self-edges** (a stmt's reads ∩ its own writes) are excluded: scan nodes read their own
state names across iterations, which is not a forward dependency.

Termination: on each recursive call with `fuel > 0`, at least one stmt is emitted (or
`remaining` is already empty), so the fuel strictly decreases. Setting `fuel := stmts.length`
is sufficient. Using a `Nat` fuel parameter (rather than `partial`) means Lean accepts the
definition without a `decreasing_by` proof, and equation lemmas exist for Phase 4. -/

/-- Is `sc` eligible to emit given `emitted` names? Eligible iff every name it reads that
    is an internal dependency (written by some OTHER stmt in `all`, excluding self-edges)
    is already in `emitted`. -/
private def eligible (sc : ScanStmt) (all : List ScanStmt) (emitted : List String) : Bool :=

    selfWrites.contains r ||
    all.all (fun s => s.writes == selfWrites || !s.writes.contains r) ||
    emitted.contains r)

/-- Fuel-bounded stable Kahn's sort. `all` is the full stmt list (fixed); `remaining` is
    what's left to emit; `emitted` accumulates written names of already-emitted stmts;
    `acc` accumulates emitted stmts in order. -/

/-- Is `ordered` a valid topological order of `all`? Walks `ordered` left to right, replaying

    given only the names emitted by stmts strictly before it. On a genuine DAG this always
    holds for `topoSort`'s output; on a cycle, `topoSortFuel`'s fallback (`acc ++ remaining`)
    appends the un-orderable remainder in source order, so the first such stmt fails
    `eligible` here (its internal-dependency read was never emitted before it). External reads
    (not written by any stmt in `all`) are not internal dependencies, so `eligible` already
    treats them as vacuously satisfied — they never cause a false cycle report. -/

/-! ## Phase 8 — `route`

The executable back-end's final phase: turn the scheduled statements into a `ThreadedComposed`
— a routed DAG of `BrBaseP` steps. Build is two-pass:

1. PASS 1 (indexing). Assign each `ScanStmt` a step index `0,1,…`. Build `nameToStep`
   mapping every produced tensor name (for a `.scan` node, ALL its `writes` names) to its
   step index. Number the external read names `0,1,…` in first-seen order (over reads, NOT
   `Finset.toList`, which is noncomputable) into `extIndex`.

2. PASS 2 (build). For each step's representative stmt — for `.scan`, the first recurrence
   stmt, else the first base stmt (it carries the reads/axes):
   * LHS (retained) axes = the `AxisSpec`s named by `free`/`iterAt`/`iterNext` slots.
   * Read axes = every `AxisSpec` in the read-factor index expressions.
   * Contracted axes = read axes whose `uid` is NOT among the LHS axis uids.
   * `degree` = (LHS ++ contracted) de-duplicated by uid; each → `AxisP (some name) (var name)`
     (symbolic size — sizes aren't load-bearing in E2a). LHS axes first, then contracted.
   * `op` = `BrOp` constructor from `rhs.nonlin`/`rhs.agg`/stmt kind; scan nodes use scan variants.
   * `inputWeaves` = one shape per read factor; `outputWeaves` = one shape; each over `degree`,
     mapping contracted axes (by uid) to `.tiled`, retained axes to `.fixed a`.
   * `reindexings` = one `StMatP` per read factor; `idxToRow` expresses each read coordinate as
     an integer-affine combination of the degree axes (column order = degree order).
   * `routing[i]` = per read factor: `Wire.internal j 0` (output of producer step `j`) if
     internal, else `Wire.external (extIndex nm)`.

/-- Read-arity well-formedness (Track A #1): every INTERNAL read `rf` (routed to producer step `j`,
    slot `slot`) provides as many index positions as the producer publishes axes. This is an UPSTREAM
    property — `checkReadRanks` pins read arity to the declaration, and the producer's published rank
    (`tensorAxes (slotStmt slot)`) is that declaration's axis count — NOT a routing invariant, so it
    is carried as an explicit hypothesis (cf. the acset `WellShaped` and `topo_bound`'s `hrc`). Its
