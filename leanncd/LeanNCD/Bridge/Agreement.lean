/-! ## Phase 4 — `compile_wellFormed`: every compiled program is `WellFormed`

`compile = compileToScheduled >>= route`, and `route` is now two stages (§2.5): checked
physicalization of the LOGICAL schedule into a `PhysicalRouteProgram`, then the unchanged
`routeCore` on that program's PHYSICAL statements. `compile_eq_physical_route` walks both stages
and isolates `tc` as `routeCore physical.scheduled`'s output, after which each `WellFormed`
conjunct is a fact about `routeCore` exactly as before.

Agreement consumes only three things — successful `routeCore`, the external-count equality, and
`wellFormedDom` — so no fragment evidence (coverage, contiguity, exits, freshness) is threaded
into `wf_typeMatch`, `wf_singleOutput`, or `wf_topo`. The logical/physical distinction is invisible
to them: they only ever see the physical program `routeCore` succeeded on. -/

/-- Plumbing: a successful `compile` factors as a successful `compileToScheduled` (giving the
    LOGICAL schedule), a successful `physicalizeForRoute` (giving the checked physical package),
    and a `routeCore` on the physical program that produced `tc`'s steps/routing, with
    `tc.nExternal = physical.scheduled.extNames.card`. -/

/-- **The compiler theorem: every compiled program is `WellFormed`** (discharges `realize`'s
    precondition on real input).

    Statement UNCHANGED by the logical-schedule flip (§2.5). Only the internal witness moved: the
    scheduled program the conjuncts are proved against is now `physical.scheduled` (the checked
    physicalization) rather than `compileToScheduled`'s own output. `test/Bridge/AgreementTest.lean`
    pins this exact type. -/

/-- §8.2 acset extraction (`from_tensor_program`): a ThreadedComposed's tabular twin. A
    systematic/synthetic encoding (see `2026-07-01-acset-agreement-impl-plan.md`) — no attempt at
    Python `from_tensor_program`/`OpTag` fidelity, just enough that `toThreadedComposed` (Task B)
    can invert it (Task C), which is all `realize_fromThreadedComposed_agree` below needs. -/
def fromThreadedComposed (tc : ThreadedComposed) : Acset.SBrInstance :=
  AcsetCodec.fromThreadedComposed tc

/-- **Prop 8 (DSL/CSV agreement).** The DSL-path realization of `tc` and the CSV-path
    realization of its extracted `SBrInstance` are the SAME `Br` morphism (equal as
    `Σ (dom cod : BrObj), BrMorph dom cod` values — same objects AND same morphism).

    Proof: `realizeSBr` decodes the extracted instance and replays `realize`, so this reduces to the
    round trip `toThreadedComposed (fromThreadedComposed tc) = tc` (Task C, `AcsetCodec`) plus
    proof irrelevance on the `WellFormed` witness. The round trip needs `tc.WellShaped` (the shape
    invariant `WellFormed` does not carry — `routing.length = steps.length` + per-step reindexing
    dims); every compiled program satisfies it, so the agreement holds for all real programs. -/
